2020-08-19 22:12:03	deltasquared	.... ah bingo. got the C++ elderich incantation to work. forgot that any constraints have to fire inside *template resolution* to kick the overload out. can't be a static_assert alone. (dang that's gonna cost some boilerplate :/ )
2020-08-19 22:12:39	paulguy	make a template for it to generate the template :p
2020-08-19 22:12:41	deltasquared	template <unsigned N, typename = enable_if_t<(N > 0)>> struct under_test { ...
2020-08-19 22:13:01	deltasquared	paulguy: well this sort of boilerplate can only be done via macros right now sadly
2020-08-19 22:14:30	deltasquared	theoretically it should be possible to write helpers, but I find in practice you run afoul of the vagueness in the standard about what counts as the allowed deduction contexts for this magic trick to work without giving the compiler indigestion.
2020-08-19 22:14:51	deltasquared	and so macros proliferate...

2020-08-19 22:18:44	deltasquared	also fun though somewhat obvious fact, you need those parens around the boolean expression else the gt symbol gets parsed as the closing template bracket.
2020-08-19 22:19:05	paulguy	debuggers can have a hard time telling you where a macro was.
2020-08-19 22:19:25	deltasquared	indeed. hence why the language standard gets proposals to slowly phase them out.
2020-08-19 22:19:25	paulguy	well, where in a macro you've stopped
2020-08-19 22:20:00	deltasquared	in my case, debugging isn't really the point - I'm writing compile time tests. the compiler has enough info to remember what macros expanded from what.
2020-08-19 22:20:13	deltasquared	(in error messages)
2020-08-19 22:20:16	paulguy	crustyvm retains that information :p
2020-08-19 22:20:41	paulguy	the tradeoff is you may have no idea where you your procedure the macro was called that errored
2020-08-19 22:24:00	deltasquared	paulguy: here's the example now I got it to work - https://a.uguu.se/XNmwnRDEEOka_sfinae.txt
2020-08-19 22:24:13	deltasquared	enable_if is the only thing not explained there, it's a simple version of std::enable_if
2020-08-19 22:24:28	deltasquared	you can think of it as a type that is "not there" if the boolean it gets is false.
2020-08-19 22:24:44	deltasquared	that causes under_test to in turn be "not there" if N == 0
2020-08-19 22:25:02	deltasquared	and the second overload of typechecks() then becomes nonsensical
2020-08-19 22:25:16	deltasquared	so it falls back to the first, which is a weaker match for what I'm passing (a dummy int)
2020-08-19 22:25:25	deltasquared	the first returns false, and I can detect that
2020-08-19 22:26:24	deltasquared	the varargs ellipsis from C (...) is always the "least favourable" when deciding which overload to pick. it's literally at the end of the list in the revelant bit of the standard IIRC.

2020-08-19 22:27:02	deltasquared	so what's going on is the compiler wants to select the version that actually takes an int as a parameter, but if that would produce a type that can't exist then it has to try something else.
2020-08-19 22:27:03	paulguy	good god haha
2020-08-19 22:27:22	deltasquared	ikr, so long winded but it's all we've had to do something like this for a while
2020-08-19 22:27:55	paulguy	oh right you've reimplemented the STL, so you'll definitely know this stuff haha
2020-08-19 22:28:03	deltasquared	needless to say, one could reasonably be excused for reaching for macros
2020-08-19 22:28:09	deltasquared	paulguy: hah, only a very tiny part. :>
2020-08-19 22:28:42	deltasquared	enable_if there is literally https://a.uguu.se/tL3oGD2ZU3M0_enable_if.txt
2020-08-19 22:29:07	deltasquared	see how one version of enable_if has a nested member, where the other one doesn't?
2020-08-19 22:29:23	deltasquared	(then the _t is just an alias of that to make it nicer to type)

2020-08-19 22:29:59	deltasquared	so ignoring the alias, in the false case compiler goes "wtf there is no ::type member, this can't exist, oh welp better try something else"
2020-08-19 22:31:03	deltasquared	paulguy: LAWL, I just tl;dr'd in my head as "probing type properties by giving other types existential crisises"

2020-08-19 23:01:00	deltasquared	indeed, some of his stuff has aged much worse
2020-08-19 23:01:01	Namarrgon	the tin in the can is the least dangerous part
2020-08-19 23:01:12	paulguy	hmm, was feeling kinda tired and crap but I just had some chicken and drank some water and i feel a lot better.
2020-08-19 23:01:32	deltasquared	paulguy: ah, the ancestral diet :P
2020-08-19 23:02:14	h4rd3n3D	paulguy:  because I don't have access to a lab, and sure as Hell am not going to safety/taste test a 45 year-old 'tin' of tuna inside my easily poisoned body ;p
2020-08-19 23:02:15	paulguy	i mean chicken is tasty
2020-08-19 23:02:35	paulguy	yeha that's why you watch someone on youtube do it.
2020-08-19 23:02:45	paulguy	or watch people eat surstromming

2020-08-19 23:04:31	Namarrgon	steve is okay
2020-08-19 23:04:55	paulguy	also my understanding is culturing is actually not something terribly inaccessible without a lab. :p
2020-08-19 23:05:12	paulguy	you might not get as good results, though.
2020-08-19 23:05:16	deltasquared	paulguy: well I mean just look at the thought emporium on youtube
2020-08-19 23:05:21	paulguy	hah yeah
2020-08-19 23:05:30	paulguy	i mean, he has a proper lab really.
2020-08-19 23:05:38	paulguy	but it's a bit ad-hoc
2020-08-19 23:05:43	deltasquared	paulguy: he does bits and bobs without it sometimes
2020-08-19 23:05:48	paulguy	still has put a lot of work and money in to it.

2020-08-19 23:06:06	paulguy	but if someone wants to do a simple culturing experiment, it's really a middle-school classroom level experiment. :p
2020-08-19 23:06:41	deltasquared	I'm just amazed the guy mostly cured his lactose intolerance for a while.
2020-08-19 23:06:58	deltasquared	he's still a bloody mad man for trying that on himself but was nonetheless quite cool
2020-08-19 23:06:59	paulguy	at least, it's something i did in middle school and i didn't go to any sort of nice or fancy middle school at all haha
2020-08-19 23:07:39	paulguy	deltasquared, i like how he had to plead to people not to do the experiment on themselves when he released a revision to his lactose intolerance experiment.  he only tried the one himself because it had already gone through some rigor.
2020-08-19 23:08:18	deltasquared	paulguy: some would be that desparate though. he himself knew how batshit crazy it was doing something like that, but he knew exactly what the risks were.
2020-08-19 23:08:28	paulguy	which it is kind aneat that if that's your hobby and you have some money to hand that isn't like, crazy pfizer stock value or something, you can kinda do some crazy stuff like that.
2020-08-19 23:08:28	deltasquared	(doing something like that to himself)
2020-08-19 23:09:14	paulguy	but telling someone not to experiment on themselves with genetic therapy if they don't understand the risks should be akin to telling someone not to see what happens when you drink bleach.

2020-08-19 23:10:36	h4rd3n3D	deltasquared:  I think you meant he assumed he knew how batshit crazy that was; and was merely lucky it it did not completely fuck him up ;p
2020-08-19 23:11:06	paulguy	well like I said, the experiment he performed i'm pretty sure he said had been around a while and has had human trials.

2020-08-19 23:12:52	paulguy	although it probably won't be that partiular brand, it's just the only breyer's i know.
2020-08-19 23:13:04	deltasquared	compared to the gene therapy on himself, the other stuff on his channel ("whose gene is it anyway?" and others) seems tame in comparison lol
2020-08-19 23:13:09	paulguy	also i think there might be a brand of toys or something named breyer
2020-08-19 23:13:23	deltasquared	I think capsucin tomatoes might have a market for instance
2020-08-19 23:13:40	paulguy	i don't watch those.  I'm sure they're interesting but it's 2+ hours of unedited talk stream :p

2020-08-19 23:19:08	yakubin	russian => hardcore.
2020-08-19 23:19:10	yakubin	:)
2020-08-19 23:19:16	paulguy	pretty hardcore folks when it comes to that sort of thing yeah
2020-08-19 23:19:31	deltasquared	h4rd3n3D: seriously though, every time he took out a resistor in the safety chain and was describing how much harder it was to let go (the main reason mains is dangerous) I got genuinely scared
2020-08-19 23:20:02	deltasquared	he had various safety switches nearby but still.
2020-08-19 23:20:18	deltasquared	it struck a healthy fear of mains power into me for a bit
2020-08-19 23:20:27	deltasquared	not a paranoid fear, just... I had to go think

2020-08-19 23:23:09	paulguy	well, the way tasers work and not (usually) kill the person is that it's high voltage and thus high current, but it's in short enough bursts that it doesn't usually disrupt the heart.
2020-08-19 23:23:43	paulguy	and the total power over time isn't enough to generally cause tissue damage
2020-08-19 23:23:47	h4rd3n3D	BTW: => 0.1 A from the mains will take your ass out
2020-08-19 23:23:56	paulguy	that is, no heating up/cooking tissue

2020-08-19 23:24:55	paulguy	current isn't just some fixed characteristic of the supply.  that is, a certain amount of voltage in to a particular resistance will produce a particular current.
2020-08-19 23:24:58	deltasquared	paulguy: it's a bit of both really. you need to have a certain voltage due to ohm's law to cross the lethal current threshold, but then also the source has to be able to keep that current up as well. (naturally mains has no problem with 100mA whatsoever)
2020-08-19 23:25:48	paulguy	but as far as the body and other materials go, there's breakdown due to accumulated tissue damage which reduces resistance.
2020-08-19 23:25:59	first-order	32X should never have been a thing, Sega should've upped the abilities of the Genesis or SegaCD hardware instead.

2020-08-19 23:31:01	h4rd3n3D	paulguy:  tasers, especially the newest Model 7, work with very low voltage and extremely low amps (~0.01) iirc 
2020-08-19 23:31:06	first-order	Cell is PPC.
2020-08-19 23:31:30	paulguy	ah, so then the newer designs are safer which is good.  probably relies on skin effect or something.
2020-08-19 23:31:43	deltasquared	then there's nintendo who seem to be sticking to trying to get still enjoyable games out of more limited ARM processors.
2020-08-19 23:31:49	deltasquared	nothing wrong with that
2020-08-19 23:31:59	paulguy	sony stuck with MIPS for a while, heh.
2020-08-19 23:32:06	first-order	IIRC the reason why you could natively play PS1 games on a PS2 was because it was basically an upgraded PS1 under the hood.
2020-08-19 23:32:07	paulguy	PS1 and 2 were MIPS, PSP was MIPS.
2020-08-19 23:32:24	paulguy	PS2 had a whole PS1 in it :p
2020-08-19 23:32:33	deltasquared	first-order: with extra co-processors slapped on the side IIRC?
2020-08-19 23:32:36	paulguy	and the original PS3 had a whole PS2 in it :D
2020-08-19 23:33:00	deltasquared	(emulation of the PS2 was always challenging from experience for that reason. it certainly used all my coars)
2020-08-19 23:33:11	paulguy	i don't think the PS2's architecture as far as its main CPU goes is that related to the PS1 beyond both being MIPS, the PS2 literally just had a PS1 on a chip.

2020-08-19 23:37:07	h4rd3n3D	nah - Tasers work, and don't kill, by 'locking up' your body because NMI (Neuro Muscular Incapacitation) only requires an extremely small flow of current (i.e. Amps).

2020-08-19 23:38:01	paulguy	first-order, the expansion slot was actually a good idea even if it was never used, but making hardware specifically incompatible in the hopes to resell old games to you is shady

2020-08-19 23:38:50	deltasquared	reselling old games in general seems to be nintendo's motivation for ripping a new one in all those rom sites. :/
2020-08-19 23:39:03	paulguy	yeah

2020-08-19 23:41:27	deltasquared	not necessarily matching a strict date of release order, but it sorta vaguely follows that
2020-08-19 23:41:38	paulguy	now there's a full Nintendo game release database so one could now use canonical release numbers. :p

2020-08-19 23:42:26	paulguy	first-order, i'm not going to dust that one off too much but just enough to say that they both excelled in particular things and really couldn't be compared quantitatively.
2020-08-19 23:42:51	deltasquared	I find it amusing for instance in a sort of admittance of defeat that sonic features in super smash.

2020-08-19 23:45:08	deltasquared	some marketing term picked up the words "blast" and "processing" and just went mad
2020-08-19 23:45:18	deltasquared	err, marketing person picked up the term rather
2020-08-19 23:45:25	paulguy	oh yeah i think it was about the DMA stuff
2020-08-19 23:45:34	first-order	SNES had better graphics, better sound, and actually expanded its hardware via the SuperFX chip.
2020-08-19 23:45:49	paulguy	was described as like, blasting data fro ROM to RAM or soemthing
2020-08-19 23:46:12	paulguy	i would say maybe technically better sound in some ways
2020-08-19 23:46:22	h4rd3n3D	deltasquared:  to your earlier point, that is exactly why an electric eel is unlikely to kill you.  It cannot transmit its electric field continuously, it can only pulse it.  Your average Amazon Basin river eel can nail your ass with 700+ V and 1+ A but only for a few milliseconds (each pulse).  Lethal as Hell for other fish, but you'll live, unless he bites you wickedly ;p
2020-08-19 23:46:33	paulguy	but the genesis could seem to produce some kinds of sounds that the snes couldn't that were pretty good.
2020-08-19 23:46:40	paulguy	SNES was bad at bass
2020-08-19 23:46:56	paulguy	not impossible but a lot of music on the SNES just lacks bass
2020-08-19 23:47:14	first-order	Despite sampled audio being technically better than FM synth.
2020-08-19 23:47:23	deltasquared	paulguy: not to mention if you play those games in a modern emu, you can increase the yamaha chip's effective sampling rate.
2020-08-19 23:47:33	deltasquared	so it sounds crisp AF for an older game console
2020-08-19 23:48:28	paulguy	too much "crisp" and it just sounds tinny and harsh.  that's kinda a downside to FM synthesis.
2020-08-19 23:48:44	deltasquared	it does vary a bit on the game I guess.
2020-08-19 23:48:55	first-order	One of the best examples of sampled audio being superior to FM synth is GM/GS and XG destroying the OPL3 on a SoundBlaster.

2020-08-19 23:50:28	paulguy	that stuff was in the order of $100s just for that single component, versus the consoles being $300 for the entire setup :p

2020-08-19 23:51:53	paulguy	but yeah musicians were able to squeeze a lot out of the SNES, but the Genesis on average I think just had at least more fun, energetic soundtracks with more range.
2020-08-19 23:52:38	first-order	But that was well after PC gaming truly became a thing.
2020-08-19 23:53:11	first-order	IIRC the SB Live! and first-gen Audigy came out in the same time period as the cards I refer to.

2020-08-20 12:27:36	deltasquared	my task in the meantime is preparing medical evidence for the benefits service, oh joy
2020-08-20 12:27:37	miro	oh, how was it? you haven't freaked out in the tunnel?
2020-08-20 12:28:04	deltasquared	miro: like being in a very large and clunky photocopier. I'm not known for claustrophobia.
2020-08-20 12:28:22	deltasquared	the tone and quality of the noise changes over time so it didn't get too overwhelming.
2020-08-20 12:28:30	miro	haha inb4 copy of deltasquared somewhere out there
2020-08-20 12:28:45	deltasquared	I mean if they got a copy of my brain that works properly...
2020-08-20 12:29:36	mpan	Copies on the photocopier are usually worse. :>
2020-08-20 12:30:10	miro	I was just curious, my brother had to cancel it, walked out ... since then I'm wondering how it must be
2020-08-20 12:30:32	deltasquared	miro: was it the confinement, noise, both that he said?
2020-08-20 12:31:18	deltasquared	I imagine if I suddenly had the need to pee halfway through the noise might start to get annoying because it'd be like hurry up and finish already, but otherwise I'd be fine doing it again.
2020-08-20 12:31:37	miro	I think the confinement, but he doesn't have claustrophobia either
2020-08-20 12:32:03	deltasquared	ngl it wasn't a particularly large tunnel, but then my head was locked in place by a harness of sorts
2020-08-20 12:32:08	miro	well I suppose as a lot of thing phobias exists on a spectrum
2020-08-20 12:32:12	miro	*things
2020-08-20 12:32:31	miro	i see
2020-08-20 12:32:42	deltasquared	despite said harness I had a greater difficulty holding my head still just due to the mechanical vibrations exerted by the magnetics
2020-08-20 12:33:13	deltasquared	never mind my own natural twitches (like heartbeat, which when you're trying to hold perfectly still suddenly becomes annoyingly noticeable)
2020-08-20 12:33:50	miro	ah
2020-08-20 12:34:01	deltasquared	miro: sod's law really, day after scan I had the worst attack of the head vise to date. if only it'd occurred on the day maybe it would be more obvious
2020-08-20 12:35:17	deltasquared	though perhaps then the noise would have been unbearable to me.
2020-08-20 12:35:31	miro	hmm, maybe FMRI would be more helpful? idk
2020-08-20 12:35:46	deltasquared	as it stands it was loud but I was given ear defenders so it wasn't uncomfortably so.
2020-08-20 12:35:58	deltasquared	I felt the noise more than anything I guess
2020-08-20 12:37:02	deltasquared	was certainly interesting waiting for it. everything mobile in the surrounding rooms was labelled whether it was MR safe or not to take inside the chamber.
2020-08-20 12:37:19	deltasquared	chamber itself has some chonk metal lining visible through the door frame
2020-08-20 12:37:33	deltasquared	they are serious about their EM cage that's for sure
2020-08-20 12:38:21	miro	yeah, can imagine, I remember waiting for my mom once in waiting room, and I could hear those noises, it reminded me arc welding, you know those kinda short burst zzzzzz
2020-08-20 12:38:41	deltasquared	it did sound like mains power noise at one point.
2020-08-20 12:38:52	deltasquared	but then it changed and varied about in pitch
2020-08-20 12:39:05	deltasquared	like I said other times it'd sound like an old clunky scanner
2020-08-20 12:39:12	deltasquared	and others it kinda sounded like a linear drive motor
2020-08-20 12:39:42	deltasquared	I passed my time trying to conceive of what must be going on inside the thing to make such an array of sounds
2020-08-20 12:39:45	miro	ah yeah loud scanner, that's a good analogy
2020-08-20 12:39:49	svito	#aot, where ppl fix their cars or something, IDK
2020-08-20 12:40:19	deltasquared	I didn't get the chance to quip this study to them either - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYAvxe9X3s0
2020-08-20 12:40:37	deltasquared	actually playing music on the magnets *and* getting viable results at the same time
2020-08-20 12:41:10	deltasquared	I mean it sounds boxy as hell but it'd still probably be way nicer than what I heard
2020-08-20 12:42:15	miro	lol, tfw using super-expensive machine for making silly (but impressive) youtube video

2020-08-20 12:42:32	deltasquared	miro: no there's an actual serious paper behind this
2020-08-20 12:42:37	deltasquared	(see the description)
2020-08-20 12:42:43	deltasquared	the point being to calm patients a bit
2020-08-20 12:42:59	deltasquared	but they also see how useful the data from such a scan is medically
2020-08-20 12:43:18	miro	:o
2020-08-20 12:43:22	deltasquared	sadly it's journal paywalled but the synopsis given is most interesting indeed
2020-08-20 12:44:08	deltasquared	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26178439/
2020-08-20 12:44:09	phrik	Title: Music-based magnetic resonance fingerprinting to improve patient comfort during MRI examinations - PubMed (at pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
2020-08-20 12:44:45	deltasquared	short version of the results on that page without paying for the entire thing suggests it was pretty close to "normal" scans
2020-08-20 12:44:46	opt1mus	what
2020-08-20 12:45:16	miro	hah crazy
2020-08-20 12:45:29	deltasquared	miro: thinking musically, I have a better way to describe the MRI sounds
2020-08-20 12:45:33	deltasquared	the floppotron
2020-08-20 12:45:48	deltasquared	if they varied the frequencies a bit they could play music just like that thing
2020-08-20 12:46:15	miro	owait, you mean that array of floppydisk drives?
2020-08-20 12:46:34	miro	lol floppotron, didn't know it had a name
2020-08-20 12:46:48	deltasquared	specifically this rendition, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9qy0utP2QM
2020-08-20 12:47:29	deltasquared	not kidding if they played semitones of the sounds I heard you could make exactly that floppotron piece
2020-08-20 12:47:44	opt1mus	I could get an MRI scan to the resonant frequency of Motley Crue?
2020-08-20 12:47:56	svito	where phrik titties for videos again
2020-08-20 12:48:04	opt1mus	Kickstart My Heart
2020-08-20 12:48:07	deltasquared	opt1mus: in theory. I think it'd need way more testing to ensure the data they get back isn't affacted
2020-08-20 12:48:10	miro	haha amazing

2020-08-20 12:53:55	deltasquared	mpan: I mean it's somewhat obvious that any coils that big are gonna rattle a bit under operation, but like I was trying to comprehend why all the different sorts of noises and at different frequencies.
2020-08-20 12:54:28	deltasquared	also it was interesting that there seems to be multiple sets inside, as the sound source seemed to move around.

2020-08-20 21:18:50	paulguy	ah those
2020-08-20 21:19:33	paulguy	so how do you make them soda?
2020-08-20 21:22:36	sangy	demize: there's soda made of that? how does it taste?
2020-08-20 21:23:02	demize	paulguy: *shrg*, similar to how other things are made turned into soda I guess.  :p
2020-08-20 21:23:09	demize	sangy: Uh... I don't know how to describe it?
2020-08-20 21:23:29	sangy	like is it aromatic like the rosewater soda or is it more full bodied like guarana soda?
2020-08-20 21:23:43	sangy	I assume it's aromatic, but who knows
2020-08-20 21:25:11	demize	Hmmr.
2020-08-20 21:25:23	demize	Well, guarana soda isn't a thing here, so I've only had it once and don't remember what it tasted like.
2020-08-20 21:25:43	demize	But I guess I would describe this as almost a fruitier/flowery cola-esque thing.
2020-08-20 21:25:50	sangy	I see
2020-08-20 21:25:54	sangy	one day, maybe
2020-08-20 21:26:22	demize	With almost a liquorice-like character, somehow.
2020-08-20 21:26:34	demize	Which isn't a great description, but \o/
2020-08-20 21:26:38	demize	It's tasty anyway.
2020-08-20 21:26:43	sangy	nice, enjoy!

2020-08-20 21:27:54	demize	I would recommend trying it if you can get it somehow, mmh.
2020-08-20 21:28:09	demize	I could definitely see how it wouldn't be for everyone, but definitely worth a shot.
2020-08-20 21:28:37	Foxboron	It's dangerous to move
2020-08-20 21:28:47	Foxboron	then realize there is greek gyros 3 mins walk from your house
2020-08-20 21:29:13	Foxboron	Fuck me it's so good
2020-08-20 21:29:18	Foxboron	proper meat
2020-08-20 21:29:27	Foxboron	As in they stack and and chop it off
2020-08-20 21:29:46	Foxboron	which many places in norway can't do because the meat doesn't get eaten fast enough thus constitutes a food hazard
2020-08-20 21:31:23	piokozi	That sounds really nice
2020-08-20 21:31:26	demize	There's no Greek place anywhere close to where I live.  .__.
2020-08-20 21:31:29	demize	I want me some souvlaki.
2020-08-20 21:31:54	piokozi	I had some sushi today, on account of exam results \o/
2020-08-20 21:32:04	paulguy	HI SANGY!

2020-08-20 21:32:27	Foxboron	demize: I didn't find souvlaki on their foodora menu :/
2020-08-20 21:32:34	Foxboron	But i got that gyros platter
2020-08-20 21:32:39	Foxboron	and they got chili mayooooooooooo
2020-08-20 21:32:42	Foxboron	CHILI MAYOOOOOO
2020-08-20 21:32:46	sangy	paulguy: heyo!!
2020-08-20 21:32:51	Foxboron	tzatziki is nice
2020-08-20 21:32:52	demize	Mmmmh.
2020-08-20 21:32:55	Foxboron	but man CHILI MAAYYYOOO
2020-08-20 21:33:06	paulguy	just put some sriracha in mayonnaise
2020-08-20 21:33:26	Foxboron	They sell that in stores here
2020-08-20 21:33:30	Foxboron	it's soooo gooooodd
2020-08-20 21:33:34	Foxboron	sriracha mayo is great
2020-08-20 21:33:48	paulguy	i'm sure they do but you can just get the two and put them together :p
2020-08-20 21:33:57	Foxboron	Sounds like stress
2020-08-20 21:33:59	Foxboron	and less good
2020-08-20 21:34:10	Foxboron	also the sriracha taste gets a bit old after a while :p
2020-08-20 21:34:11	paulguy	nah then you can have it as mayonnaise or sriracha as you're in the mood for
2020-08-20 21:34:53	Foxboron	I think one of the best facts about the sriracha sauce is that they have spent 0 money on marketing
2020-08-20 21:35:01	Foxboron	It's all been word by mouth
2020-08-20 21:35:02	paulguy	yeah that's my worry about getting overly specific condiments is that i might get bored of them and they'll sit around and take up space and get gross.
2020-08-20 21:35:31	demize	Sriracha mayo is not anywhere near as good as proper chili mayo.
2020-08-20 21:36:26	paulguy	i think for now i'll write up the include header for crustymidi for writing DX7 parameter change sysexes
2020-08-20 21:36:58	paulguy	unfortunately, I'll just need to post it and hope for someone else to test it for me
2020-08-20 21:37:02	paulguy	because I don't have a DX7

2020-08-20 21:54:02	xulfer	so has everyone weathered the pam storm?
2020-08-20 21:54:21	sangy	no pam issues so far
2020-08-20 21:54:48	xulfer	really?  glad to hear it.  i thought everyone was having issues
2020-08-20 21:55:08	deltasquared	I'm still waiting for the bugs with systemd 246 to be investigated properly on the bug tracker, so the storm has yet to hit me as I'm holding off on the -Syu until some progress is made there.
2020-08-20 21:55:42	deltasquared	I haven't seen a convincing explaination thus far so I ain't touchin it
2020-08-20 21:56:00	deltasquared	(seriously, how do you end up with ETIMEOUT talking to your own supervision daemons?)
2020-08-20 21:56:13	xulfer	yeah i personally haven't had an issue for similar reasons... meaning i just haven't ran Syu yet

2020-08-20 21:56:38	deltasquared	xulfer: what other package caused you problems?
2020-08-20 21:57:28	deltasquared	(hey, why did I make my bittorrent volume btrfs... that's going to be a fragmented shitshow now >_>)
2020-08-20 21:57:49	xulfer	Wait... it is?
2020-08-20 21:58:01	xulfer	because i'm using btrfs :(
2020-08-20 21:58:11	deltasquared	xulfer: I forgot to set +C on it
2020-08-20 21:58:18	deltasquared	(at which point one may as well use ext4)
2020-08-20 21:58:32	deltasquared	stuff in bittorrent is completely modify-in-place
2020-08-20 21:58:42	deltasquared	that doesn't play nice with CoW filesystems
2020-08-20 21:59:26	yakubin	wtf has netflix just pulled off.
2020-08-20 21:59:35	deltasquared	torrent metadata is fetched, big empty files are fallocated, then as each piece of the file comes in (which can be in any order) that part of the file gets written in place
2020-08-20 21:59:45	xulfer	sometimes days like today i'm glad i mostly use BSD.  Not because it's superior, but they're much more hesitant to just dump changes like this onto people
2020-08-20 22:00:01	deltasquared	xulfer: this the PAM mess again I presume
2020-08-20 22:00:03	yakubin	xulfer: what bsd are you using?
2020-08-20 22:00:28	xulfer	FreeBSD, and i have one OpenBSD box but i don't use that one much
2020-08-20 22:00:41	yakubin	no linux?
2020-08-20 22:00:56	xulfer	oh i use linux obviously but I use BSD more than linux
2020-08-20 22:01:17	yakubin	cool.
2020-08-20 22:02:09	dagle	Idk, last time I used freebsd I kinda felt like I was forced to update libc/kernel often.
2020-08-20 22:02:38	xulfer	really?  
2020-08-20 22:02:51	dagle	Yupp
2020-08-20 22:03:15	xulfer	Hmm... trying to remember the last time i updated the system... it's been a while
2020-08-20 22:03:20	yakubin	how often do you need to compile stuff on bsd?
2020-08-20 22:03:26	dagle	And it depends on what you compare to. But if you compare to a stable release of a system of linux it wasn't better imo.
2020-08-20 22:03:31	deltasquared	xulfer: anyway as I was saying before, I guess you could keep all the torrent and FS metadata CoW under btrfs as regular, but the torrent files themselves better be recursively +C.
2020-08-20 22:03:33	yakubin	e.g. do base system updates need to be compiled each time?
2020-08-20 22:03:40	xulfer	Personally i still use all ports so anytime i update
2020-08-20 22:03:43	xulfer	portsnap etc
2020-08-20 22:03:58	xulfer	but a lot of people use the newer pkg system
2020-08-20 22:05:02	dagle	Also I don't like the freebsd packages of things, like openssh.

2020-08-20 22:05:17	xulfer	deltasquared: i'm running out of trackers to use so i'm worried i won't even be able to do torrents soon :(
2020-08-20 22:05:18	dagle	Maybe they have fixed that now.
2020-08-20 22:05:54	xulfer	What was wrong with openssh?  Perhaps i was lucky and just never had an issue
2020-08-20 22:06:15	dagle	xulfer: They pulled in unsafe cyphers that openbsd removed.
2020-08-20 22:06:16	deltasquared	xulfer: your ISP blackholing them all?
2020-08-20 22:06:23	SCHAPiE	The BSDs do lack a bit in multimedia and gaming opportunities
2020-08-20 22:06:49	xulfer	deltasquared: nah just trackers going down... 32pag.es is down for good it seems for instance
2020-08-20 22:06:55	first-order	Which is ironic as a BSD is what the PS4 is based on.
2020-08-20 22:07:16	xulfer	yeah and netflix
2020-08-20 22:07:52	xulfer	annnd OS X, i don't know why people that actually use BSD get the shaft while everyone seems to benefit from it
2020-08-20 22:07:57	SCHAPiE	stuff like Steam and proper DAWs
2020-08-20 22:07:59	deltasquared	hah, the last time I encountered freeBSD was actually juniper networks. their JunOS router operating system is BSD based. you can drop out from the default specialised network config shell to a BSD CLI environment.
2020-08-20 22:08:16	deltasquared	(no, I didn't work for them, nearly could have done though)
2020-08-20 22:08:46	xulfer	it kind of pisses me off because it wouldn't be difficult to support BSD as well
2020-08-20 22:09:05	xulfer	i'm glad linux is getting support but why freeze bsd out when you're using it yourself
2020-08-20 22:09:10	deltasquared	xulfer: stallman would have everyone believe it's the freeloaders argument and hence why everyone should use the GPL
2020-08-20 22:09:23	deltasquared	I mean there's probably an element of that perhaps
2020-08-20 22:10:08	xulfer	deltasquared: heh well i hate stallman and i think he's wrong on that... BUT yeah some people take advantage of BSD stuff

2020-08-20 22:11:44	xulfer	it's a hard topic to quantify really... i mean BSD has given us a ton as a *nix community, but people have also shafted us via it more than a few times
2020-08-20 22:13:20	xulfer	For instance Apple actually has and does contribute... hence llvm, clang, etc... but then you have like netflix which barely even works on linux/bsd/what have you
2020-08-20 22:13:55	paulguy	hi deltasquared.  how's the head?
2020-08-20 22:15:25	xulfer	Blah and speaking of apple... i finally got vim fixed on my macbook :/

2020-08-20 22:18:43	xulfer	because i'm pretty sure BSD has an actual UNIX license

2020-08-20 22:19:08	deltasquared	so that'll be nice
2020-08-20 22:19:11	xulfer	By that I mean berkeley got an AT&T system V license

2020-08-20 22:19:28	xulfer	oh gotcha :)

2020-08-20 22:20:08	xulfer	Just a fun fact... FreeBSD for instance actually has the legal rights to call themselves UNIX
2020-08-20 22:20:23	xulfer	But they don't.  I doubt anyone cares
2020-08-20 22:20:28	dagle	xulfer: It forced a user interface that couldn't be changed. Like gnome 3 but 5 times worse.

2020-08-20 22:20:57	dagle	Well, I didn't like the hardware either.
2020-08-20 22:21:02	dagle	Good screen though.
2020-08-20 22:21:25	dagle	Horrible keyboard and the pointer that was so fucking big that you had no place to put your arms.
2020-08-20 22:21:36	dagle	And dongle for everything.
2020-08-20 22:21:36	xulfer	i like macbooks myself... i like how long they seem to last and generally haven't had issues
2020-08-20 22:21:41	deltasquared	I encountered mac pros at university. I was sickened by mental dissonance within five minutes... where's the effing right click? ain't none. also those keyboards were trash.
2020-08-20 22:22:00	xulfer	BUT i will say that i mostly buy them because it's the one platform that lets me dev on anything if i want to
2020-08-20 22:22:03	deltasquared	too different on purpose for not much benefit

2020-08-20 22:23:23	paulguy	not that stealing is necessarily "bad". :p  but yeah causing somoene to be deprived of things isn't great, and i imagine putting it under an umbrella of "stealing" is a normative way to imply not thinking about consequences for others.
2020-08-20 22:23:50	paulguy	and to reinforce the importance of private property :)
2020-08-20 22:23:52	paulguy	:p
2020-08-20 22:23:53	dagle	xulfer: Nope, freebsd doesn't have a license. Also unix(tm) isn't the same as unix.
2020-08-20 22:24:00	xulfer	ah deltasquared beat me to it
2020-08-20 22:24:13	xulfer	dagle: oh not freebsd as a project.  I mean berkeley does
2020-08-20 22:24:20	xulfer	so in theory any BSD could have a license
2020-08-20 22:24:22	paulguy	and yeah modern apple mice have right click
2020-08-20 22:24:35	paulguy	but they don't really have buttons anymore...
2020-08-20 22:24:38	dagle	Yes but it's just a unix(tm) license. It doesn't make it unix.
2020-08-20 22:24:59	xulfer	What would you say makes something unix?  I'm just curious
2020-08-20 22:25:13	SCHAPiE	UNIX-like is the term.
2020-08-20 22:25:16	woddf2	xulfer: Certification
2020-08-20 22:25:17	deltasquared	unix-like or actual UNIX?
2020-08-20 22:25:23	SCHAPiE	There's UNIX®es
2020-08-20 22:25:27	xulfer	UNIX
2020-08-20 22:25:35	paulguy	ugh the dx7 has 156 parameters
2020-08-20 22:25:50	SCHAPiE	UNIX, INIX, WENIX
2020-08-20 22:25:54	deltasquared	paulguy: yamaha?
2020-08-20 22:25:57	paulguy	yeah
2020-08-20 22:26:01	xulfer	i mean FreeBSD for instance is nowhere close to linux in how it works, etc.  It's not just a slightly different distro
2020-08-20 22:26:09	paulguy	no i don't own one, but I'm writing stuff for crustymidi for working with one
2020-08-20 22:26:22	xulfer	It's an OS that isn't just based on the kernel.  
2020-08-20 22:26:37	yakubin	i'm converting my emacs config from a literate org-mode file to plain emacs-lisp with comments. man, this thing is long...
2020-08-20 22:26:39	paulguy	people want to be able to map a MIDI CC controller to DX7 parameters
2020-08-20 22:26:43	HEX0	yeah was a bit confused without the gnu utils when trying bsds
2020-08-20 22:26:50	deltasquared	xulfer: and a libc as stallman keeps trying to insist
2020-08-20 22:27:04	deltasquared	(or certain coreutils)
2020-08-20 22:27:04	xulfer	Yeah they have their own libc as well
2020-08-20 22:27:17	xulfer	but eh... stallman is rarely right :(
2020-08-20 22:27:23	deltasquared	so it's BSD/BSD instead of GNU/linux, go shove it stallman
2020-08-20 22:27:27	yakubin	libc is part of the OS on BSDs AFAIK.
2020-08-20 22:27:37	xulfer	^
2020-08-20 22:27:41	xulfer	yeah that's correct
2020-08-20 22:27:48	deltasquared	everything core is developed in lockstep on the BSDs anyway right?
2020-08-20 22:27:50	xulfer	They don't use glibc

2020-08-20 22:29:30	yakubin	put your home in /tmp.
2020-08-20 22:29:36	xulfer	not on my setup... maybe their installer does that now?
2020-08-20 22:30:24	xulfer	Are you thinking of OS X maybe?  That puts home in /Users/$USER
2020-08-20 22:30:28	paulguy	i don't see a problem with stuff being credited but placing GNU as equivalent to the kernel is silly.  it's about as equivalent to importance as something like systemd.  Linux is linux, GNU is GNU, systemd is systemd and whatever else you're using is whatever else you're using. :p
2020-08-20 22:30:53	xulfer	Yeah the GNU argument is dumb
2020-08-20 22:31:10	HEX0	call it a distro lol
2020-08-20 22:31:20	xulfer	Linux doesn't need GNU to exist
2020-08-20 22:31:25	paulguy	deltasquared, good thing most of the parameters are just the same thing for each of the 6 voices. :p
2020-08-20 22:31:43	paulguy	er not voices, operators
2020-08-20 22:31:49	yakubin	it's GNU/Freedesktop/X/Canonical/RedHat/Novel/Linux, stupid.
2020-08-20 22:31:52	xulfer	i mean we've been talking about BSD... Linux could just adopt the BSD userland and done... now it's linux without GNU
2020-08-20 22:31:52	paulguy	distinctly different meaningful terms
2020-08-20 22:31:59	xulfer	and it would work
2020-08-20 22:32:24	HEX0	xulfer: it's been a while since I tried BSDs. ant it was brief. personally didn't have a reason to stick with it
2020-08-20 22:32:30	paulguy	so for each one I can just copy/paste and replace the operator number then change the index numbers.
2020-08-20 22:32:31	yakubin	or things from redox.
2020-08-20 22:32:56	xulfer	HEX0: yeah either you like it or you don't.  I use both linux and BSD for various reasons :)
2020-08-20 22:33:20	yakubin	you all keep using linux and bsd. i'll stick to emacs.
2020-08-20 22:33:20	xulfer	for daily use i'd use Linux, or OS X
2020-08-20 22:33:24	HEX0	I guess I'd use something like pfsense. but for desktop not sure what I'd do with it
2020-08-20 22:33:40	xulfer	yeah
2020-08-20 22:33:51	xulfer	i wouldn't use FreeBSD for a desktop or whatever
2020-08-20 22:33:57	paulguy	not sure if the BSD tools entirely work under linux but I imagine the GNU tools do utilize various linux kernel functionality that the BSD utilities won't take advantage of, and the BSD utilities might expect certain things to be available to them on linux that just don't exist.
2020-08-20 22:34:36	paulguy	although there is gentoo-kfreebsd so
2020-08-20 22:34:39	yakubin	well. yeah. freebsd has its own async interfaces which aren't available on linux.
2020-08-20 22:34:43	paulguy	I guess you can run GNU on freebsd kernel
2020-08-20 22:34:44	xulfer	paulguy: could be correct... but since BSD is pretty strict on syscalls i imagine it wouldn't be too rough to switch over
2020-08-20 22:35:03	HEX0	paulguy: there used to be arch bsd
2020-08-20 22:35:13	paulguy	neat
2020-08-20 22:35:22	HEX0	sorry pacbsd
2020-08-20 22:35:24	yakubin	now let's do planArch
2020-08-20 22:35:26	xulfer	Heh i doubt GNU could run on BSD easily.
2020-08-20 22:35:31	paulguy	gentoo-kfreebsd is pretty much just the gentoo portage repository on top of a freebsd kernel
2020-08-20 22:35:32	xulfer	because they run their own libc
2020-08-20 22:35:41	xulfer	so the GNU stuff would take a shit over that
2020-08-20 22:36:01	paulguy	there might be some configuration and package changes to make it work
2020-08-20 22:36:01	HEX0	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PacBSD
2020-08-20 22:36:03	phrik	Title: PacBSD - Wikipedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
2020-08-20 22:36:06	woddf2	https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/src/gnu/README?rev=1.2&content-type=text/plain "Gigantic and Nasty but Unavoidable"
2020-08-20 22:36:16	paulguy	but i remember it pretty much just being more or less gentoo with freebsd as the kernel
2020-08-20 22:36:24	HEX0	"PacBSD (formerly known as Arch BSD[1]) was an operating system based on Arch Linux, but uses the FreeBSD kernel instead of the Linux kernel[2] and the GNU userland."
2020-08-20 22:36:25	xulfer	oh i think it could work, but not without some effort imo
2020-08-20 22:36:55	paulguy	it was kinda weird because all the defaults for things like shell and coreutils were as they are on gentoo linux.
2020-08-20 22:37:02	xulfer	oh i remember the gentoo bsd project... i think there was a debian one as well
2020-08-20 22:37:31	HEX0	is there practical reason to prefer that kernel and linux userland? I thought it was the other way around
2020-08-20 22:37:46	paulguy	so it was basically like using linux except for if you had to like, manage processes or devices or various other things that ar emore kernel level
2020-08-20 22:38:29	xulfer	hmm if i were to guess it would be because FreeBSD's process management, and license stuff is just... better
2020-08-20 22:38:36	paulguy	andi think this was when freebsd still had the linux kernel ABI layer so i think some binary packages worked even?
2020-08-20 22:38:55	xulfer	they still have that so yeah there's that too
2020-08-20 22:39:12	paulguy	ah.  i thought they got rid of that for ideological reasons
2020-08-20 22:39:13	deltasquared	> there's nothing quite as permanent as a temporary stop-gap.
2020-08-20 22:39:21	deltasquared	ooof I felt that one
2020-08-20 22:39:36	paulguy	and probably just not wanting to maintain something as complicated as a kernel ABI layer.
2020-08-20 22:39:41	xulfer	well my system still has linux-compat... if they got rid of it i haven't seen it
2020-08-20 22:39:56	xulfer	it's based on like redhat 8 or something so it's not exactly current
2020-08-20 22:39:58	paulguy	but probably good they stuck witht hat haha
2020-08-20 22:40:10	HEX0	LOL https://i.imgur.com/RE1uEvm.png
2020-08-20 22:40:15	paulguy	especially with stuff like Steam and Reaper
2020-08-20 22:40:31	paulguy	and blackmagic studio or whatever
2020-08-20 22:40:57	xulfer	ha yeah i don't know why bsd is always getting fucked over by stuff like steam
2020-08-20 22:41:09	xulfer	it's not hard to make something work for both

2020-08-20 22:41:35	paulguy	steam is based on chromium so it probably is using some rather exotic kernel calls
2020-08-20 22:41:47	HEX0	arent BSD GPU drivers lagging pretty bad too
2020-08-20 22:41:50	paulguy	and it does a lot of kernel device management around controllers
2020-08-20 22:42:14	xulfer	Actually no.  BSD has pretty good video driver support
2020-08-20 22:42:15	paulguy	and steam vr i think is basically build around KMS
2020-08-20 22:42:24	xulfer	unless you mean OpenBSD which can only take ATI
2020-08-20 22:42:53	paulguy	gotta dust off that old 9800 Pro for a game of Quake 3 Arena
2020-08-20 22:43:10	xulfer	Wait that's old? :(
2020-08-20 22:43:18	paulguy	and maybe Doom 3 at 10-20 FPS
2020-08-20 22:43:39	paulguy	I think AMD bought up ATi only a little after they started the "X" series of GPUs.
2020-08-20 22:43:55	HEX0	I mean in terms of GPU support. I mean we get support pretty late on mainline with amdgpu. I imagine it's worse on freebsd
2020-08-20 22:43:57	xulfer	i have a 3 year old card... what is it?  I think it's like a 970ti?  
2020-08-20 22:44:06	paulguy	well that's nvidia
2020-08-20 22:44:12	paulguy	not ATI
2020-08-20 22:44:17	xulfer	oh i know
2020-08-20 22:44:28	xulfer	i wouldn't put a legit GPU on an OpenBSD machine
2020-08-20 22:44:58	paulguy	but yeah i think freebsd somehow uses linux DRM drivers...
2020-08-20 22:45:04	deltasquared	not quite.
2020-08-20 22:45:08	+mpan	paulguy: why can’t you play Q3A on more modern hardware?
2020-08-20 22:45:10	xulfer	HEX0: actually when it comes to nvidia freebsd is pretty good
2020-08-20 22:45:22	paulguy	mpan, he mentioned openbsd only supporting ATi :p
2020-08-20 22:45:29	+mpan	Oh
2020-08-20 22:45:37	miro	HEX0: why do you lol at PacBSD? so rud
2020-08-20 22:45:43	paulguy	and that's something notable from the Ati days
2020-08-20 22:45:43	woddf2	20:42:25 < xulfer> unless you mean OpenBSD which can only take ATI  <-- Intel GPUs work fine, in my experience.
2020-08-20 22:45:44	HEX0	miro: the website
2020-08-20 22:45:50	xulfer	The nvidia website (last i checked) even has an option to download FreeBSD drivers
2020-08-20 22:45:54	deltasquared	my understanding is that in freebsd, x11 manages much more things, so it's more contingent on the freedesktop projects supporting those GPUs really
2020-08-20 22:46:20	paulguy	mpan nowadays you can just open quake 3 arena in a web browser
2020-08-20 22:46:34	+mpan	Yep.
2020-08-20 22:46:40	paulguy	as much as you'd hate that idea, it's kinda neat.
2020-08-20 22:46:43	+mpan	And the engine itself is open source and much improved.
2020-08-20 22:46:49	HEX0	heh nvidia still provides solaris gpu drivers too
2020-08-20 22:46:56	+mpan	So you can also play it natively, given you kave the pk3 files.
2020-08-20 22:46:58	xulfer	Oh do they?
2020-08-20 22:47:08	xulfer	I miss Solaris

2020-08-20 22:48:34	deltasquared	lol openarena, man that game ran at sooooooooo many FPS last time I tried it, it was hilarious how efficient they'd made the graphics pipeline. (most would not bother to optimise graphically simple games if it was "fast enough")

2020-08-20 22:49:05	paulguy	i wish someone could make a modern source port of star trek voyager elite force that plays the single player campaign.
2020-08-20 22:49:13	xulfer	running around shooting someone for like 30 seconds is dumb to me :(
2020-08-20 22:49:18	paulguy	i know there's an open source version but it's only holomatch
2020-08-20 22:50:01	deltasquared	ooh, it's in the ubuntu repositories. could fire it up on the laptop here seeing as it ain't been converted to arch yet...
2020-08-20 22:50:04	paulguy	xulfer, unless you get the rocket launcher but yeah the like machine gun thing you get kinda blows
2020-08-20 22:50:22	deltasquared	bah, give me the railgun any day
2020-08-20 22:50:23	paulguy	but it's supposed to blow, because you're supposed to get other weapons :p
2020-08-20 22:50:24	HEX0	xulfer: maybe red orchestra is more your style if you're into realism. or arma 3
2020-08-20 22:50:47	xulfer	could be!  i haven't played arma 3

2020-08-20 22:56:09	deltasquared	paulguy: well phoronix benchmark many-core CPUs using llvmpipe for instance
2020-08-20 22:56:34	paulguy	he doesn't test much wine games though
2020-08-20 22:56:51	paulguy	and i think goldsrc is still windows only
2020-08-20 22:56:53	HEX0	xulfer: but if you can grab it on sale arma 3 is pretty damm addictive despite the buggy engine. has a mission editor and kinda infite sandbox. that coop server was a lot of fun
2020-08-20 22:57:26	paulguy	so if you want OG half life natively, there's always black mesa
2020-08-20 22:57:43	paulguy	but that probably won't work through llvmpipe :D
2020-08-20 22:58:29	HEX0	paulguy: so they use some kind of wrapper for hl1 on linux?

2020-08-20 22:59:46	yakubin	apparently there is an emacs package for uploading to 0x0.st
2020-08-20 23:00:22	HEX0	it's opengl so ran quite well. replayed half life 1 steam linux version a few weeks ago. still a great game
2020-08-20 23:00:24	paulguy	hex0, i don't think so?  is half life 1 running natively nowadays?
2020-08-20 23:00:26	+mpan	So now emacs even has a paste service. What about a decent text editor?

2020-08-20 23:01:29	paulguy	i suppose they ported goldsrc then.
2020-08-20 23:01:38	deltasquared	paulguy: I actually just tried running minetest under llvmpipe. that was actually nowhere near as bad as I expected.
2020-08-20 23:02:04	deltasquared	it was only a slowdown by a factor of six compared to GPU execution.
2020-08-20 23:02:08	HEX0	paulguy: wikipedia says "Valve released versions of the GoldSrc engine for OS X and Linux in 2013, eventually porting all of their first-party titles utilizing the engine to the platforms by the end of the year."
2020-08-20 23:02:12	deltasquared	not always playable mind but was interesting nonetheless
2020-08-20 23:02:48	+mpan	I wonder if someone will finally write a vim extension to Emacs, so the vim vs Emacs war is over.
2020-08-20 23:03:17	deltasquared	makes me wonder if intel was actually on to something with that whole "slap a many-core on a pcie slot and call it a GPU" idea.

2020-08-20 23:05:04	paulguy	deltasquared, neat.
2020-08-20 23:05:53	paulguy	probably still better to develop an architecture/processor around processing graphics than relying on generic x86 :p
2020-08-20 23:06:07	deltasquared	couldn't get it working though. didn't even appear to have a VGA BIOS or support the EFI GOP due to being an engineering sample.
2020-08-20 23:06:40	deltasquared	paulguy: oh for sure if they tried that idea again they could at least use a different instruction set rather than letting pride get in the way...

2020-08-20 23:27:17	deltasquared	huh, bigalloc and delayed allocation don't get along it seems. web searches suggest it runs into premature ENOSPC a bit like btrfs was known for.
2020-08-20 23:27:31	paulguy	first-order, we got a fairly reasonable PCJr once the Tandy computers came around.
2020-08-20 23:27:35	deltasquared	a shame, torrent FS is mostly gonna be BIG files.

2020-08-20 23:29:07	paulguy	beest yeah.  in the 90s especialyl when symphony of the night came out, windows _barely_ supported it, and you had to actually draw in each kanji you wanted to use :p

2020-08-20 23:32:50	paulguy	but it really kinda took them until around 2010 for the big developers to really care much about the PC platform, before that it was a lot of doujin games.

2020-08-21 14:02:53	Foxboron	there are no alternatives and the propreitary version is more bugged
2020-08-21 14:03:02	Lartza	That is possible
2020-08-21 14:03:17	Lartza	Doesn't make the situation much better still :P
2020-08-21 14:03:23	Foxboron	It's feature complete for all practical purposes
2020-08-21 14:03:30	Foxboron	unless there are breaking bugs there isn't that much to work on
2020-08-21 14:03:34	Lartza	Last I used was some weird fork of Synergy iirc
2020-08-21 14:03:44	Foxboron	barrier is a fork of synergy v1
2020-08-21 14:03:44	Lartza	Or the original open source one without any fixes
2020-08-21 14:03:54	Foxboron	which is the FOSS version
2020-08-21 14:03:57	Lartza	Right but what I mean is what I used was still called Synergy for all I remember
2020-08-21 14:04:04	Foxboron	Yep, same
2020-08-21 14:04:19	Foxboron	But synergy had bugs and synergy v2 was proprietary so been looking for alternatives
2020-08-21 14:04:21	Lartza	But it was after they went propietary still, so some kind of a weird situation where Barrier did not exist yet
2020-08-21 14:04:23	Foxboron	moved to barrier now

2020-08-21 17:36:36	first-order	Assuming the 5200 shared most of its hardware with the 8-bit line, a graphics chip from the 8-bit line on a cart for a coprocessor would've been kinda cool if doable though.
2020-08-21 17:36:42	deltasquared	ah, bus contention, one of those fun hardware problems
2020-08-21 17:37:14	paulguy	deltasquared, if not contention, at least it might've only been exposed to some number of address pins or something along those lines, though i dunno in that case.
2020-08-21 17:37:15	deltasquared	now I randomly recall something about cycle stealing settings in pcsx2.
2020-08-21 17:37:52	first-order	Although the Atari console hardware is far less advanced than the Master System or NES were.
2020-08-21 17:38:01	paulguy	i didn't know the 5200's hardware was that different from the atari 8 bit computers.
2020-08-21 17:38:21	paulguy	i had heard it was basically just the most bare minimum memory configuration and no keyboard.
2020-08-21 17:38:21	first-order	IIRC the Master System even had a low-power YM3812 on some carts.
2020-08-21 17:38:32	paulguy	although maybe that was just the XEGS

2020-08-21 17:39:41	first-order	(and the Famicom had a number of vendor-specific sound expansion chips, most commonly the VRC6 for Konami titles)

2020-08-21 17:42:00	first-order	And the SNES is very well-known to make heavy use of the SuperFX chip.
2020-08-21 17:42:17	paulguy	like if you wanted to get your kid a like $40 cheap video game or something, I imagine the famicom was very cheap.
2020-08-21 17:42:47	beelzebuzz	these freezes are driving me crazy
2020-08-21 17:42:54	first-order	Still would've been pretty cool for the 5200 and 7800 to have made heavier use of the 8-bit computer hardware on its carts though.
2020-08-21 17:43:19	paulguy	no idea but i guess make sure your vbox modules are built for your specific kernel, although in arch i imagine that's just handled automatically.
2020-08-21 17:43:20	first-order	Eg. the POKEY chip being a major sound upgrade for BallBuster.

2020-08-21 17:58:09	deltasquared	it was ultimately moot in my case because the game I wanted to play had a PSX port, which ultimately (and kinda ironically, given it was always emulated) worked far more reliably.
2020-08-21 17:58:35	paulguy	yeah back in the day when the console port was usually better anyway :p

2020-08-21 18:03:40	paulguy	and even on top of that, the write can still hold up the CPU.
2020-08-21 18:03:50	paulguy	if it takes many clocks to complete
2020-08-21 18:03:53	first-order	IIRC most people had either an early SoundBlaster or SB Pro, or an AdLib card at the time the first Doom came out, all FM synth vs. SNES' sampled audio.

2020-08-21 18:04:44	deltasquared	my brain wonders if that 2D raytracing could be simulated in hardware partially in a technique similar to "blast processing" on the genesis with realtime palette mem overwrites. sorta like advancing some memory locations for texture lookups during scanout perhaps.
2020-08-21 18:04:46	paulguy	so you could definitely get a faster 32 bit VLB or PCI VGA card with fast memory accesses that don't hold up the CPU as long and see performance benefits in games like Doom or Quake.

2020-08-21 18:44:57	paulguy	an average UNIX installation was considerably larger than most consumer desktop operating systems, and had a much larger memory footprint (but was better at utilizing the memory for a multi-user system past that certain base footprint)
2020-08-21 18:45:36	deltasquared	scaleable systems often have a higher base cost (that would persist even in an "idle" state).

2020-08-21 18:48:03	paulguy	and it still relied a lot on the macintosh ROM for a lot of services.

2020-08-21 18:50:51	deltasquared	I had read some material that suggested countersunks were better at spreading load into the surrounding material when incorporating screws with 3d parts.

2020-08-21 21:11:46	paulguy	but yeah jaguar was complicated.  Saturn too.
2020-08-21 21:12:11	paulguy	kinda the way they had to do it to make it cheap to produce.  Sony definitely had the upper hand in having in house development and production.

2020-08-21 21:15:15	paulguy	well stuff like the jaguar or saturn probably just had CPUs with memory regions and maybe some kind of access to each others' memory either through copies or a shared memory space or it's possible both CPUs just shared and took turns accessing memory

2020-08-21 22:00:02	jelle	it was lol OH HELL NO

2020-08-21 22:06:50	deltasquared	kevr: the spaces is to prevent confusing the preprocessor for the most part.
2020-08-21 22:07:03	kevr	C++11 fixed that
2020-08-21 22:07:10	kevr	you dont need spaces for templates anymore
2020-08-21 22:07:18	kevr	vector<map<int, int>>
2020-08-21 22:07:23	deltasquared	no, I said to prevent confusing the preprocessor, not the lexer
2020-08-21 22:07:51	kevr	interesting
2020-08-21 22:08:07	deltasquared	I've ran into problems with the ## paste operator before now if one is not gratituous with spaces
2020-08-21 22:08:20	deltasquared	something like "pasting formed XYZ, an invalid token"
2020-08-21 22:08:21	kevr	ahh, i see.
2020-08-21 22:08:45	deltasquared	I am aware of the former most vexing parse though
2020-08-21 22:09:00	deltasquared	(namely >> always being recognised as right shift)
2020-08-21 22:09:23	kevr	ic
2020-08-21 22:10:42	deltasquared	as for template class you derive from, well that's the part that's different each time. here's an example of how I use it: https://a.uguu.se/sgs568yOyvJt_usage.txt
2020-08-21 22:11:03	deltasquared	the bit the macro is doing is generating the boilerplate that forces the fallback path to produce a different answer that can be detected.
2020-08-21 22:11:36	deltasquared	("fallback path" in overload resolution, namely when something nonsensical comes up during type substitution, so compiler goes "I'ma pretend I didn't see that")
2020-08-21 22:12:14	deltasquared	err maybe not the derive from bit.
2020-08-21 22:12:49	deltasquared	still, the point of the macro is to avoid having to define those two functions and a templated variable each time. (yes, the latter is C++14 I know)
2020-08-21 22:13:09	deltasquared	at least by hand anyhow.

2020-08-21 22:20:01	kevr	depends what T is
2020-08-21 22:20:04	deltasquared	if your T can't default construct, then reservation cannot occur.
2020-08-21 22:20:08	deltasquared	think more generally.
2020-08-21 22:20:09	+SysGhost	phrik: is birbs > cats ?
2020-08-21 22:20:10	phrik	Arguably true!

2020-08-21 22:20:18	kevr	yes, that's true
2020-08-21 22:20:55	deltasquared	kevr: it'd work if your T eithe default constructs or (more efficiently) is trivial, meaning it's not UB to have an "uninitialised" T merely potentially existing.
2020-08-21 22:21:08	kevr	indeed
2020-08-21 22:21:10	jelle	SCHAPiE: ooo still 2-2
2020-08-21 22:21:19	kevr	i don't see how that's a problem though
2020-08-21 22:21:33	SCHAPiE	jelle› Yea, it's fun to watch, there's tension.
2020-08-21 22:21:37	deltasquared	kevr: well that depends. you didn't specify you wanted your minivector to only support such types.
2020-08-21 22:22:01	kevr	there are some requirements of types that you store in a vector, or other containers
2020-08-21 22:22:01	jelle	SCHAPiE: need to switch to main screen
2020-08-21 22:22:11	first-order	(in this case, ISO400, 10s exposure, 84mm focal length, at F4.4 with the ground lit up by a bunch of sodium-vapor street lights)
2020-08-21 22:22:12	kevr	you need to fit those concepts.
2020-08-21 22:22:20	kevr	that's an agreement you make with the interface
2020-08-21 22:22:25	deltasquared	kevr: right, but for std::vector at least, being default constructible ain't one of them.
2020-08-21 22:22:36	deltasquared	at least, not last time I checked.
2020-08-21 22:22:55	paulguy	my butt makes an agreement with the toilet interface
2020-08-21 22:22:57	deltasquared	if you wish to require that in your vector thing, so be it
2020-08-21 22:23:11	first-order	If I had used 'Daylight' white balance, that scene would be orange-tinted as hell.

2020-08-21 22:26:42	kevr	i think im compiling this with 14 or 17
2020-08-21 22:27:27	deltasquared	kevr: what I meant was, std::vector does not *require* default constructibility, and therefore you might have to deal with preparing storage for them appropriately instead of "just" having an array of T under the hood.
2020-08-21 22:27:52	kevr	i see
2020-08-21 22:27:55	deltasquared	who knows, maybe some STLs specialise the vector class depending on whether the class is trivial or not.

2020-08-21 22:28:52	paulguy	oof would be fun to get a different vector<T> depending on what T is that may have unexpectedly different behavior.
2020-08-21 22:29:08	paulguy	oh jeez it's onyl 4:30, I thought it was like 8 haha
2020-08-21 22:29:48	kevr	tbh, i don't think it's as flimsy as you think it might be
2020-08-21 22:30:14	kevr	if your T is not default constructible and you decide to just add another element, you can't unless you construct it properly
2020-08-21 22:30:18	deltasquared	paulguy: well it's the difference between a heap allocated array of "plain T" where some elements are merely uninitialised (where that's not UB because T is trivial), or a heap allocated array of some aligned storage type (say each elem is a struct with a char data[sizeof(T)] and an alignas specifier)
2020-08-21 22:30:54	deltasquared	kevr: hence what I said about needing something to represent the storage you allocated for this task.
2020-08-21 22:31:07	paulguy	deltasquared i guess
2020-08-21 22:31:10	kevr	can you give an example?
2020-08-21 22:31:17	jelle	SCHAPiE: oh I hate this commentator
2020-08-21 22:31:18	deltasquared	if it's not a plain array of T, it must be... something else
2020-08-21 22:31:23	kevr	because i've never needed specific manual memory allocs/memset for that
2020-08-21 22:31:29	kevr	object construction and destruction works fine for me

2020-08-21 22:32:52	jelle	*lukaku
2020-08-21 22:33:00	deltasquared	it just boils down to how std::vector must be implemented to not be UB in itself
2020-08-21 22:33:07	kevr	vector capacity is just ensuring that sizeof(T) * capacity is allocated inside the vector.
2020-08-21 22:33:14	deltasquared	kevr: *and* aligned.

2020-08-21 22:33:38	paulguy	do the members of vector need to be contiguous?

2020-08-21 22:34:45	paulguy	growing a vector is probably slow then...
2020-08-21 22:34:51	deltasquared	oh yeah
2020-08-21 22:34:54	kevr	it uses a table doubling method
2020-08-21 22:34:55	deltasquared	copy constructors everywhar
2020-08-21 22:34:56	kevr	with a load factor
2020-08-21 22:35:12	kevr	when you reach cap, it resizes it with the load factor, has to copy over all the elements

2020-08-21 22:35:30	deltasquared	paulguy: to grow a vec literally requires new storage allocating and *move* constructing sorry each elem from the original

2020-08-21 22:35:55	deltasquared	then it still has to manually ~T() on each element in the old array
2020-08-21 22:35:59	kevr	it is exactly that, paul

2020-08-23 00:07:29	th0rne	That's not stdin, though?
2020-08-23 00:08:12	paulguy	not sure what you mean then
2020-08-23 00:08:27	mkxone	sage then i should first learn what stdin really is. i did "echo 'blah' | nc -l host port"
2020-08-23 00:08:33	mkxone	yes my terminology is prob wrong
2020-08-23 00:09:18	paulguy	well
2020-08-23 00:09:20	paulguy	hmm
2020-08-23 00:09:30	th0rne	Stdin is like what you type into terminal, I think. If you pipe something into a program, it will know it didn't come from stdin.
2020-08-23 00:09:34	paulguy	can nc -l send data?
2020-08-23 00:09:51	paulguy	th0rne, it can know it's not a tty, but it's still stdin

2020-08-23 00:13:09	paulguy	i'd say maybe nc is behaving differently because it's not a tty, but that's kinda the intended way to use netcat

2020-08-23 00:19:50	mkxone	but idk if that's the best way to go about it.

2020-08-23 00:22:07	th0rne	But at least programs know if they're outputting to a pipe as opposed to stdout?
2020-08-23 00:23:43	paulguy	you can use isatty() to determine what it is.
2020-08-23 00:23:57	paulguy	otherwise you can just read or write it.
2020-08-23 00:24:05	paulguy	difference is a pipe may block

2020-08-23 00:25:09	th0rne	For instance jq gives you color output by default if outputting to stdout, but you need a flag to get colors if outputting to a pipe.

2020-08-23 00:26:48	ox	*what a file
2020-08-23 00:26:51	paulguy	as far as the process sees, yeah, it's file descriptors, so the process can theoretically inspect it like any other file descriptor to determine what it is.
2020-08-23 00:27:08	mkxone	th0rne, like "nc -l <<< file" ?

2020-08-23 04:41:27	paulguy	not good enough either
2020-08-23 04:42:12	kevr	i suck pretty terribly at guitar.. tried to learn for like 6 months, and i only ended up really playing like 2 different songs, but never really learned it too well, just copied things
2020-08-23 04:43:02	kevr	one of them was war pigs
2020-08-23 04:43:05	kevr	lol
2020-08-23 04:43:24	paulguy	yeah i can play like
2020-08-23 04:43:28	paulguy	the chrono trigger theme song
2020-08-23 04:44:15	paulguy	and i'm rusty at it because i stopped practicing it a while ago and just started playing it again a couple days ago so I need to get the muscle memory back, but i'm already much faster and smoother since when I last played it.
2020-08-23 04:44:42	paulguy	also the star wars theme song but i haven't practiced that one in a bit
2020-08-23 04:44:48	paulguy	then a few random riffs
2020-08-23 04:44:49	kevr	acoustic?

2020-08-23 04:45:43	kevr	:D
2020-08-23 04:46:19	paulguy	so all it's good for is occasionally making it go out of tune
2020-08-23 04:46:21	paulguy	:p
2020-08-23 04:46:34	kevr	ha
2020-08-23 04:46:36	paulguy	it's actually pretty alright for that though heh
2020-08-23 04:46:55	kevr	hmm.. i cant remember where i left mine..
2020-08-23 04:46:58	paulguy	there's plenty of hard tail electric guitars though
2020-08-23 04:47:00	kevr	maybe its in the oakland storage
2020-08-23 04:47:26	kevr	but i only have one of those really weak portable amps, but its pretty cool because it works but the battery dies pretty fast
2020-08-23 04:47:38	paulguy	it's just there's a _lot_ of strat style guitars out there haha
2020-08-23 04:47:41	kevr	i think i got it from the dude who had the electric guitar
2020-08-23 04:48:09	paulguy	there's a lot of really nice portable amps nowadays.
2020-08-23 04:48:10	kevr	yeah, i remember now, he was like "i got this amp if you want it," im like "what's an amp"
2020-08-23 04:48:19	kevr	boom
2020-08-23 04:48:27	homerj	goes the dynamite
2020-08-23 04:48:52	paulguy	i have an alright little practice amp
2020-08-23 04:48:59	paulguy	plenty loud for my room
2020-08-23 04:49:04	kevr	paulguy: its pretty badass but it has a little bit of weird static noise on it
2020-08-23 04:49:13	kevr	maybe thats normal though for an amp
2020-08-23 04:49:15	kevr	idkj
2020-08-23 04:49:20	paulguy	probably would be alright for playing for like a small bar or something too.
2020-08-23 04:49:29	paulguy	single coil or humbucker?
2020-08-23 04:49:32	kevr	nice
2020-08-23 04:49:40	kevr	...i really have no clue man
2020-08-23 04:49:51	kevr	let me see if i can find one online that looks like it
2020-08-23 04:49:56	paulguy	well, tht the pickups have 1 row of magnets or 2 rows?
2020-08-23 04:49:59	paulguy	did the*
2020-08-23 04:50:33	kevr	uhhh
2020-08-23 04:50:40	kevr	the amp just had a hole that i put the electric guitar plug in
2020-08-23 04:50:44	kevr	then it worked
2020-08-23 04:50:54	kevr	i dunno about the internals to it
2020-08-23 04:51:04	paulguy	i mean on the guitar. :p
2020-08-23 04:51:08	kevr	oh lol
2020-08-23 04:51:18	kevr	im not sure on that either. i didnt buy it from a store or anything.
2020-08-23 04:51:22	paulguy	single coil pickups just naturally pick up a lot of interference.
2020-08-23 04:51:27	kevr	i dont think it was even branded
2020-08-23 04:51:32	paulguy	ah
2020-08-23 04:51:42	paulguy	branding will usually be on the headstock
2020-08-23 04:51:46	kevr	yeah
2020-08-23 04:51:51	kevr	there was nothing
2020-08-23 04:51:56	paulguy	but yeah there's plenty of just cheap unbranded stuff heh
2020-08-23 04:51:59	kevr	i got it for like $25 too
2020-08-23 04:52:03	kevr	WITH the amp
2020-08-23 04:52:08	kevr	craigslist
2020-08-23 04:52:10	paulguy	although nowadays even the cheapie brands will put stuff on
2020-08-23 04:52:47	kevr	but to be fair, i didnt know anything about electric guitars at all, so i dont think it was too terrible to use that one at first..
2020-08-23 04:52:56	paulguy	certainly
2020-08-23 04:53:42	homerj	general rule with guitars from what I understand is if you're starting out, get the cheapest stuff you can
2020-08-23 04:53:43	paulguy	although with a lot of second hand guitars you get the problems where tehy're jsut abused and you find out there's something wrong with it after the fact if you don't know what to look for.
2020-08-23 04:53:50	paulguy	yeah heh
2020-08-23 04:54:24	homerj	if you stick with it, when you want to get something better, you also know what you want and what to look for
2020-08-23 04:54:51	paulguy	but you can get stuck with something with a bunch of neck relief and the truss rod is cranked all the way heh.
2020-08-23 04:55:19	kevr	i stuck with it for a while, but.. its hard to use for me tbh
2020-08-23 04:55:21	paulguy	not much you can do with that other than just try to play it like that
2020-08-23 04:55:27	kevr	usually i cant play it when im living with roommates
2020-08-23 04:55:29	kevr	in sf
2020-08-23 04:55:33	paulguy	and playing a guitar like that is just not fun
2020-08-23 04:55:34	kevr	ist just too loud
2020-08-23 04:55:45	paulguy	headphones :p
2020-08-23 04:55:57	kevr	yeah thats something i wanted to use for quite a while
2020-08-23 04:56:02	kevr	but the amp had no plugin for it
2020-08-23 04:56:06	paulguy	ah
2020-08-23 04:56:30	paulguy	nowadays you can probably find some cheap like aliexpress dongle basically that plugs in to the guitar and just has a headphone jack :p
2020-08-23 04:56:40	kevr	i also kinda got discouraged
2020-08-23 04:56:59	kevr	i just felt like.. i was spending so much time to try to learn it, but i was still shit after months
2020-08-23 04:56:59	paulguy	probably won't sound amazing but as long as you can hear what you're playing, probably not bad to start out.
2020-08-23 04:57:09	paulguy	yeah that's normal :p
2020-08-23 04:57:09	kevr	oh thats neat
2020-08-23 04:57:11	paulguy	I'm still crap
2020-08-23 04:57:47	kevr	one thing i do really wanna do is write software that helps artists out
2020-08-23 04:57:54	kevr	honestly man, artists amaze me
2020-08-23 04:57:59	paulguy	like crustymidi :p
2020-08-23 04:58:08	kevr	yeah thats a perfect example!
2020-08-23 04:59:18	kevr	what's it called is here in SF, i should try to apply for them
2020-08-23 04:59:19	kevr	Dolby
2020-08-23 05:00:02	paulguy	if you work for a company doing audio, you'd probably want to be careful if you do any audio-related open source contributions.
2020-08-23 05:00:04	kevr	... well ive wanted to but ive also been kinda scared because i dont know much about audio in software, so i would just be applying as a complete noob with like one program that i ever made
2020-08-23 05:00:22	kevr	ah, makes sense
2020-08-23 05:00:52	paulguy	i mean, probably the same for any programming or just any sort of research or development job
2020-08-23 05:01:12	kevr	hm, idk about that
2020-08-23 05:01:15	kevr	like
2020-08-23 05:01:24	kevr	there's non competes and ndas absolutely
2020-08-23 05:01:26	kevr	in cali at least
2020-08-23 05:01:38	kevr	but past that, companies can't force you to not work on other software

2020-08-23 05:02:50	paulguy	yeah.  it's more that you'd have to be careful to make sure they can't possible make any claim that you exposed any knowledge or used work-time or anything.
2020-08-23 05:02:59	kevr	ye
2020-08-23 05:03:06	paulguy	and be able to defend yourself
2020-08-23 05:04:13	kevr	to be fair though i probably wouldn't contribute to open source audio software if i was at dolby
2020-08-23 05:04:17	kevr	just to be safe
2020-08-23 05:04:46	paulguy	yeah that's what I mean, you'd more likely just have to decline contributing

2020-08-23 05:04:56	kevr	:<

2020-08-23 05:10:18	kevr	like piano or something like that
2020-08-23 05:10:24	paulguy	i dunno
2020-08-23 05:10:30	kevr	hm
2020-08-23 05:10:32	paulguy	i mean, knowing the theory probably helps
2020-08-23 05:10:55	paulguy	but it probably won't require any less practice
2020-08-23 05:11:02	paulguy	maybe if you already know a string instrument

2020-08-23 05:11:31	kevr	that makes sense

2020-08-23 05:25:02	kevr	oh i see
2020-08-23 05:25:13	kevr	so midi has its own protocol
2020-08-23 05:25:16	kevr	that you speak to
2020-08-23 05:26:12	kevr	well from/to sysex
2020-08-23 05:26:34	paulguy	yep
2020-08-23 05:26:39	paulguy	sysex is just a kind of message
2020-08-23 05:26:48	paulguy	generally just means it's vendor-specific
2020-08-23 05:26:51	kevr	lets make a gui application for that thing!
2020-08-23 05:27:13	kevr	in GTK!
2020-08-23 05:27:13	paulguy	where control change is just a normal part of MIDI and you can get stuff with knobs and sliders and stuff that emit CC messages.
2020-08-23 05:28:19	paulguy	a GUI could be useful
2020-08-23 05:28:33	paulguy	there's no way to control it though

2020-08-23 05:32:26	paulguy	it doesn't really need a terminal or anything once it's running.  it connects through JACK.
2020-08-23 05:33:22	kevr	yeah so thats what im curious about and gotta find out. is it that JACK connects up to a guitar and changing knobs on the guitar causes MIDI CC messages that need to be forwarded or something

2020-08-23 05:34:04	kevr	maybe JACK just produces certain protocol output for what you change on the physical device
2020-08-23 05:34:11	kevr	then you pick that up and forward it?
2020-08-23 05:34:37	paulguy	there are MIDI guitars but typically you'd use a tabletop MIDI controller of some sort.
2020-08-23 05:34:45	kevr	ah ic
2020-08-23 05:34:50	kevr	do you have an emulator i can use for it?
2020-08-23 05:35:11	paulguy	Cadence comes with an "xy controller" and there are probably other MIDI controller packages.
2020-08-23 05:35:34	paulguy	if you don't want to tie JACK in to ALSA, you'll want something specifically for JACK though
2020-08-23 05:37:23	kevr	ah, so you have midi knobs/sliders, those affect the output sound
2020-08-23 05:37:32	kevr	understood!
2020-08-23 05:37:41	paulguy	yeah.  but as far as MIDI is concerned it's just a controller number and value
2020-08-23 05:37:41	 *	kevr hopefully
2020-08-23 05:37:46	kevr	gotchaa
2020-08-23 05:38:02	paulguy	it's up to the instrument or synthesizer or whatever to do something with it
2020-08-23 05:39:08	paulguy	MIDI has defined various controller numbers to mean things but it's really just suggestions.
2020-08-23 05:39:10	kevr	i need to get my hands both on an emulated input and emulated output

2020-08-23 06:18:09	kevr	intrusive in what way?
2020-08-23 06:18:56	paulguy	well, it has to become part of your audio set up in some way.
2020-08-23 06:19:05	paulguy	(unless you're OK with it not outputting audio)
2020-08-23 06:19:13	kevr	oh i see
2020-08-23 06:19:22	paulguy	on here it's shimmed between pulseaudio and ALSA
2020-08-23 06:19:41	kevr	i guess i can just use a vm
2020-08-23 06:19:49	paulguy	and if you're on like a laptop or something maybe a bit power-limited, it's maybe not something you want on all the time.

2020-08-23 06:22:04	paulguy	hmm?
2020-08-23 06:22:45	kevr	how do you connect up alsa to it, then it to pulse?
2020-08-23 06:23:16	paulguy	i think it installs a plugin for pulse or something
2020-08-23 06:23:29	kevr	ah
2020-08-23 06:23:34	paulguy	and cadence configures pulse to play out of the JACK sink
2020-08-23 06:23:54	paulguy	you can still stop pulse and tell it to play from the ALSA sink
2020-08-23 06:24:03	paulguy	er
2020-08-23 06:24:05	paulguy	stop JACK
2020-08-23 06:24:36	kevr	gotcha
2020-08-23 06:26:09	paulguy	there's other, more manual approaches and I'm sure people have written shell scripts to change modes.
2020-08-23 06:27:46	kevr	what are these scripts, some kind of assembly-like script
2020-08-23 06:27:55	kevr	interesting
2020-08-23 06:28:15	paulguy	crusty scripts
2020-08-23 06:28:45	kevr	made by paulguy?
2020-08-23 06:29:03	paulguy	what?
2020-08-23 06:29:19	kevr	did you make this scripting language or is it known?
2020-08-23 06:29:35	paulguy	i made it
2020-08-23 06:29:43	kevr	ahhh
2020-08-23 06:29:45	kevr	:+1:
2020-08-23 06:30:18	kevr	i like it
2020-08-23 06:31:02	paulguy	i designed it because a requirement for JACK processing is that you don't make system calls or anything that could reschedule execution, so no mmap
2020-08-23 06:31:11	paulguy	so no malloc
2020-08-23 06:31:30	paulguy	so a proper dynamic scripting language wouldn't do
2020-08-23 06:31:34	kevr	ic
2020-08-23 06:33:59	paulguy	so there's just a simple heuristic that determines how much memory a script will need
2020-08-23 06:34:09	paulguy	and you can always tell it to accumulate more
2020-08-23 06:34:14	paulguy	with the stack command
2020-08-23 06:34:57	kevr	this makes me think... are there any programming languages that dont do syscalls at all?
2020-08-23 06:35:05	kevr	and if not.. should we MAKE ONE?!
2020-08-23 06:35:09	kevr	lol
2020-08-23 06:35:21	kevr	probably a bad idea :P
2020-08-23 06:35:25	paulguy	yeah, crustyvm doesn't :p
2020-08-23 06:35:54	kevr	yeah, i just wonder like, a standard one around for everyone that wants to do syscallless programming
2020-08-23 06:35:58	paulguy	at runtime, it has no way to affect anything externally without registering functions for it
2020-08-23 06:35:59	kevr	i guess crustyvms idea could just be adapted
2020-08-23 06:36:09	paulguy	oh
2020-08-23 06:36:11	kevr	for like, other JACK programmers
2020-08-23 06:36:14	kevr	and stuff
2020-08-23 06:36:30	paulguy	i imagine for some you could provide your own malloc based on a static memory pool
2020-08-23 06:36:52	kevr	true... LD_PRELOAD the syscallless overrides!
2020-08-23 06:36:54	paulguy	but implementing a scripting language is simpler than memory allocation
2020-08-23 06:36:55	kevr	COULD DO!
2020-08-23 06:36:58	paulguy	yeah
2020-08-23 06:37:16	paulguy	or some scripting language frameworks probably have their own way of you providing memory allocators
2020-08-23 06:37:34	kevr	they have it in C++ too
2020-08-23 06:37:47	paulguy	i mean, there's no reason you have to use malloc() at all
2020-08-23 06:37:52	kevr	you can provide a specific allocator for like, containers, a lot of stl stuff
2020-08-23 06:38:11	paulguy	it's just a part of stdlib
2020-08-23 06:38:15	kevr	even string i think
2020-08-23 06:38:24	kevr	ye
2020-08-23 06:38:31	paulguy	C++ probably has an allocator it falls back on for STL
2020-08-23 06:38:45	kevr	yes, its always defaulted to one that works for the implementation
2020-08-23 06:38:47	paulguy	like, a master memory management deal
2020-08-23 06:38:48	kevr	depending on os, etc
2020-08-23 06:39:24	paulguy	it's one of those computer science problems that is beyond me.
2020-08-23 06:39:46	kevr	you always downplay yourself
2020-08-23 06:39:55	kevr	all it takes is time and learning
2020-08-23 06:40:13	paulguy	i just learned about wait() today
2020-08-23 06:40:29	paulguy	i'm pretty behind on things
2020-08-23 06:40:37	kevr	catching up quick!
2020-08-23 06:40:59	paulguy	i'm also 31.  there's probably 12 year olds that understand this stuff
2020-08-23 06:41:15	kevr	paulguy: for instance, i know how to do some things that you would call "beyond you," but i cant even step into making anything useful for JACK until i learn and practice
2020-08-23 06:41:23	kevr	so... JACK is beyond me, currently
2020-08-23 06:41:53	paulguy	JACK you just need to learn the API.  there's no extensive problem solving needed really.
2020-08-23 06:42:29	kevr	most things that seem complicated aren't actually too complicated to implement for exactly that reason
2020-08-23 06:42:32	kevr	like
2020-08-23 06:42:39	kevr	think about someone that wants to implement sha256
2020-08-23 06:42:39	paulguy	the header is pretty well documented
2020-08-23 06:42:46	kevr	they literally just go look at sha256 mappings on wikipedia
2020-08-23 06:42:52	kevr	then code something for it
2020-08-23 06:43:00	kevr	they dont create sha256 themselves
2020-08-23 06:43:09	paulguy	i looked at MD5 once and got stuck at the polynomial stuff
2020-08-23 06:43:26	kevr	given more time, you would overcome it
2020-08-23 06:43:35	kevr	i'm confident of that with anyone on earth
2020-08-23 06:44:16	paulguy	luckily i was just trying to figure out what i did wrong with what I was doing with the rather miserably documented openssl
2020-08-23 06:44:38	paulguy	and yeah reading in to the algorithm did help with what i messed up on

2020-08-23 07:05:31	paulguy	well, it was surround encoding
2020-08-23 07:06:05	paulguy	it was a surround soundtrack that when "decoded" would produce 4.0 or 5.0 or 5.1 or something soundtrack
2020-08-23 07:06:13	paulguy	obviously not like, totally discrete
2020-08-23 07:06:32	paulguy	well, a stereo sountrack*

2020-08-23 07:06:48	paulguy	but would sound totally normal played in stereo
2020-08-23 07:07:00	paulguy	it wasn't.  it was played over a surround sound system

2020-08-23 07:32:24	paulguy	or how to implement a mutex
2020-08-23 07:32:39	kevr	xulfer: does that qualify for an interview question #2 at a later time?
2020-08-23 07:32:47	xulfer	wtf... places have asked you to implement a mutex?
2020-08-23 07:33:04	paulguy	me?  no, but someone mentioned a place they work for did.
2020-08-23 07:33:10	xulfer	kevr: eh not here at aleast.  i mean here it's more about how you TRY to solve it
2020-08-23 07:33:16	xulfer	not about actually solving it
2020-08-23 07:33:18	kevr	i had to implement a greedy mutex/lock for the interview at my last job
2020-08-23 07:33:27	kevr	but they were distributed software on clusters, so it kinda makes sense
2020-08-23 07:33:28	xulfer	but since you just nailed it you'd pass
2020-08-23 07:33:33	kevr	oh, nice!
2020-08-23 07:33:55	paulguy	i didn't understand to use function pointers until hinted
2020-08-23 07:33:55	xulfer	the things that would make you fail is stuff like 1000 printf's
2020-08-23 07:33:58	paulguy	because i'm dumb
2020-08-23 07:34:21	xulfer	paulguy: well as i said i was doing a lot with those at the time so i was just lucky
2020-08-23 07:34:39	xulfer	it's kind of a tricky question, but if you try at least it shows you know what you're doing

2020-08-23 07:35:51	kevr	no, i didn't.

2020-08-23 07:36:13	kevr	i literally just thought about it and answered it best i could, but before you said i got it, i was still trying to think about a better solution
2020-08-23 07:36:39	kevr	though modulo does seem like it would make a better solution
2020-08-23 07:36:49	kevr	turn 1k ptrs into 10
2020-08-23 07:37:17	xulfer	and i actually figured it out and answered right (after hours of thinking), but i can't even answer now since i'm drunk

2020-08-23 07:38:28	xulfer	it's a very difficult problem and it's meant to draw out your thought process
2020-08-23 07:38:33	kevr	no he's not, at all.
2020-08-23 07:38:47	xulfer	it's not often someone just out and out comes up with the answer

2020-08-23 07:39:36	xulfer	if i wanted the answer i would say... do it in a single function.  Which is kind of a hint, but also cripples the thought process
2020-08-23 07:40:40	xulfer	i've seen some interesting stuff when people go at that problem unaware... and those people i'm like... wow this guys needs to be hired

2020-08-23 07:41:25	xulfer	nah you're not
2020-08-23 07:41:48	xulfer	okay how would you have solved it before kevr just gave the correct answer?
2020-08-23 07:42:08	paulguy	i already knew the answer because i already solved it for you
2020-08-23 07:42:19	paulguy	but only after hints
2020-08-23 07:42:47	xulfer	well you knew how to use the hints.  That's perfect
2020-08-23 07:43:07	paulguy	yeah that doesn't really count
2020-08-23 07:43:10	xulfer	i couldn't say those hints to some random python guy and get an answer
2020-08-23 07:43:47	xulfer	A you know what functions pointers are and how they would work, and B you know what modulo is
2020-08-23 07:44:05	xulfer	and you would think knowing modulo would be common... it's not
2020-08-23 07:44:15	kevr	in your solution
2020-08-23 07:44:27	kevr	did you just 1000 % i and check to see if that had 1 remainder?
2020-08-23 07:44:27	paulguy	i never used modulo
2020-08-23 07:44:35	kevr	well, no conditionals... wait...
2020-08-23 07:44:35	paulguy	i still don't even know how modulo works for that problem
2020-08-23 07:44:40	xulfer	i know but i'm just saying you knew what that was
2020-08-23 07:44:53	xulfer	so you'd pass almost on that alone :P
2020-08-23 07:45:07	paulguy	i used division
2020-08-23 07:45:20	xulfer	both you and kevr know what i was describing
2020-08-23 07:45:20	paulguy	but yeah looks like kevr figured it out again
2020-08-23 07:45:58	kevr	ahhhhhh
2020-08-23 07:46:02	xulfer	so what?  that's not what matters... yeah if you just fully answer it then great
2020-08-23 07:46:06	kevr	so you used the print function as arr[0]
2020-08-23 07:46:11	kevr	and quit as arr[1]

2020-08-23 07:48:50	xulfer	when i tried to solve it i was thinking macros, and all sorts of things
2020-08-23 07:49:06	xulfer	but that's what we want to see
2020-08-23 07:50:08	xulfer	it's made to be a hard problem that makes you think.  I mean yeah kevr solved it but you actually thought about it and thought about new ways to solve it
2020-08-23 07:50:33	xulfer	that both proves that you know C, and that you know how to solve problems that we normally have issues with
2020-08-23 07:50:54	xulfer	so long story short You and kevr are both hired :)
2020-08-23 07:51:28	kevr	Hey, nice!
2020-08-23 07:51:58	xulfer	and whomever mentioned the vim macro would be hired too... i mean typing out 1000 printf's is a fail but the vim macro makes that solution kind of cool :)

2020-08-23 07:54:17	xulfer	if i gave you a hint it wasn't a vim macro so it must have been someone else
2020-08-23 07:54:19	kevr	but you're a smart guy.
2020-08-23 07:54:30	xulfer	because i've never seen a vim macro solution
2020-08-23 07:54:38	paulguy	you're just responding to me feeling like shit about myself which i appreciate, but it doesn't mean the majority of people would find me useful or even worthy of life.
2020-08-23 07:55:03	xulfer	i'm telling you i've never seen a macro solution
2020-08-23 07:55:13	xulfer	so if you said it before then you are the first
2020-08-23 07:55:50	paulguy	last time i said i could yank the line and put it some number of times and vim makes it easy to repeat an action some number oftimes.
2020-08-23 07:56:02	paulguy	it's part of vimtutor even
2020-08-23 07:56:12	xulfer	yeah that works
2020-08-23 07:56:46	xulfer	but how are you going to increment the number in the yank scenario?
2020-08-23 07:57:46	paulguy	it's not needed, you're just filling an array with the same function pointer
2020-08-23 07:58:01	xulfer	YES!  good :)
2020-08-23 07:58:17	xulfer	see you're great and i'm not being patronizing
2020-08-23 07:58:33	xulfer	what you said is actually better than what i was thinking
2020-08-23 07:59:04	paulguy	well no because i didn't know about the function pointer solution until ou hinted
2020-08-23 07:59:13	paulguy	and even then you could use a variable and just yank 2 lines
2020-08-23 07:59:21	paulguy	and increment it between lines
2020-08-23 07:59:37	xulfer	well back up before you feel bad... i did say it's easily google-able
2020-08-23 07:59:41	paulguy	like printf("%d\n", i); i++;
2020-08-23 07:59:51	kevr	you have a slight imposter's syndrome
2020-08-23 07:59:54	xulfer	yep that was what i was thinking
2020-08-23 08:00:03	kevr	i had it for a really long time
2020-08-23 08:00:17	paulguy	hell, even printf("*d\
2020-08-23 08:00:19	paulguy	er
2020-08-23 08:00:29	paulguy	printf("%d\n", i++);
2020-08-23 08:00:36	paulguy	if you want to be extra obfuscated
2020-08-23 08:01:01	xulfer	well that's why i like this problem... it brings out the programmer in someone
2020-08-23 08:01:17	paulguy	nobody should ever write that
2020-08-23 08:01:17	zorton	the test should be based on compiled code size and execution time 
2020-08-23 08:01:41	kevr	to be honest, that's one of the coolest interview questions i've ever encountered
2020-08-23 08:01:52	xulfer	zorton: well since that's compiler based you'd fail on that :/
2020-08-23 08:03:13	xulfer	kevr: thanks!  but yeah i mean paulguy would pass.  I feel like most in here would pass
2020-08-23 08:03:13	zorton	likely why i'm not an programmer
2020-08-23 08:03:29	kevr	lol
2020-08-23 08:03:34	paulguy	and i would've totally failed on whatever kevr's like mutex implementation thing was
2020-08-23 08:03:39	xulfer	zorton: that wasn't an insult if it came off that way i'm sorry
2020-08-23 08:03:55	xulfer	paulguy: so would i
2020-08-23 08:04:18	xulfer	i probably would base my initial implementation on sleep?
2020-08-23 08:04:34	zorton	ha! no worries there, i'm a teamster, insults are nothing
2020-08-23 08:04:41	xulfer	maybe with a DSTC reading if i wanted to be fancy
2020-08-23 08:04:56	xulfer	and i know thats wrong
2020-08-23 08:05:09	paulguy	i imagin they'd want some kind of use of atomic somethingorother
2020-08-23 08:05:21	kevr	yeah, i did use atomics
2020-08-23 08:05:24	paulguy	but i don't understand enough how that works
2020-08-23 08:06:04	xulfer	well sleep and DSTC would work... (if it's intel) but wouldn't work truly like a mutex
2020-08-23 08:06:13	xulfer	it would just block well enough
2020-08-23 08:06:54	kevr	they had us implement shared_ptr too, that was pretty fun, but it wasn't really that complicated at all
2020-08-23 08:06:59	paulguy	dunno what a DSTC is
2020-08-23 08:07:03	kevr	i ended up implementing the same exact thing that stdlib does
2020-08-23 08:07:06	kevr	with different names
2020-08-23 08:07:15	zorton	god that would piss me off in college
2020-08-23 08:07:23	paulguy	dunno what a shared_ptr is
2020-08-23 08:07:26	kevr	(caught me off guard, i never saw the impl of shared_ptr)
2020-08-23 08:07:27	xulfer	shared_ptr is easy
2020-08-23 08:07:29	zorton	some jackass in a compsci class would turn in shit that was a rip from the GNU stuff

2020-08-23 08:17:42	paulguy	it's just that he was exploited then he exploited someone else in exchange.
2020-08-23 08:17:49	xulfer	he fucked off and i had to do it
2020-08-23 08:18:02	paulguy	he just got burned by it, as he should be.
2020-08-23 08:18:07	xulfer	after making like $10000 over it
2020-08-23 08:18:28	paulguy	because freelance stuff is super unstable and exploitive.
2020-08-23 08:18:34	xulfer	maybe he got burned but if that was the case i didn't know
2020-08-23 08:18:39	paulguy	and offers no benefits
2020-08-23 08:19:08	kevr	well, yeah, but
2020-08-23 08:19:43	kevr	i mean it just depends what happened in reality. if the dude didn't do what his part of the team was, then forget him
2020-08-23 08:19:43	xulfer	after he left he called me gay... which is fine... and then left and i was just like wtf?
2020-08-23 08:20:15	kevr	what was the task?
2020-08-23 08:20:16	th0rne	What's going on?
2020-08-23 08:20:17	kevr	:D
2020-08-23 08:20:18	xulfer	yeah he just had to do our connectivity stuff
2020-08-23 08:20:27	kevr	oh shit that sounds fun
2020-08-23 08:20:33	paulguy	yeah they might've been a dick too
2020-08-23 08:20:35	xulfer	well i was working for a radio company
2020-08-23 08:20:41	th0rne	When was this?
2020-08-23 08:20:42	kevr	ahh
2020-08-23 08:20:44	kevr	i see
2020-08-23 08:20:52	kevr	i wonder if the dude couldn't get it done

2020-08-23 08:21:42	kevr	so he just ran
2020-08-23 08:21:47	xulfer	yeah he couldn't make it work
2020-08-23 08:21:57	kevr	damn
2020-08-23 08:22:22	xulfer	and i wrote a C to erlang interface before he joined
2020-08-23 08:22:38	xulfer	which took me weeks
2020-08-23 08:23:02	paulguy	i'd have similarly little respect for anyone hiring freelance work and not taking on employees with benefits.  it's a hugely exploitive relationship where you don't have to take on payroll tax or benefits or anything.

2020-08-23 08:24:23	kevr	how long did the job even take for connectivity?
2020-08-23 08:24:34	paulguy	xulfer, you consistently come off as a pro-ruling class, pro-exploitation kind of person.
2020-08-23 08:24:52	paulguy	and very defensive of people who utilize other people for personal benefits
2020-08-23 08:25:09	xulfer	how so?
2020-08-23 08:25:13	xulfer	i hate that stuff

2020-08-23 08:26:47	paulguy	and now you go and exploit people because it's beneficial to you, and you see no problem with it
2020-08-23 08:27:11	svito	good morning aot
2020-08-23 08:27:11	kevr	but how is it exploiting him if he didn't do the work?

2020-08-23 08:28:18	xulfer	i truly am sorry if i came off that way

2020-08-23 08:29:49	xulfer	i have no position :/
2020-08-23 08:29:50	paulguy	you just think you can appease me without changing anything about yourself.
2020-08-23 08:30:04	xulfer	okay what do i need to change?
2020-08-23 08:30:19	paulguy	we've already covered that

2020-08-23 08:34:37	xulfer	it's my job... do you want me to just do nothing?
2020-08-23 08:34:43	kevr	paulguy: it could be that your image of how this transpired is different than what happened in reality, or that it's the same, but we don't know any of that.. keep in mind, there are just some complete assholes in the world that screw you over
2020-08-23 08:34:45	kevr	on both sides
2020-08-23 08:35:02	kevr	i think you're kinda seeing it in a light where xulfer just got pissed at him and fired him or something
2020-08-23 08:35:16	paulguy	kevr, it doesn't matter "what happened".  it matters his relationship with that person from the get-go, and his apathy about the situation
2020-08-23 08:35:17	kevr	but.. we really don't know what happened
2020-08-23 08:35:21	xulfer	i like paulguy 
2020-08-23 08:35:34	xulfer	which is why im trying to back this off
2020-08-23 08:35:54	xulfer	apathy?
2020-08-23 08:36:28	xulfer	have you ever known me to just hurt people for the sake of it?
2020-08-23 08:36:35	paulguy	he's just "oh i lost some money fuck him" rather than "maybe people shouldn't be stuck in the situation where they're trying to occasionally make work and some people are lucky and catch a break and hey maybe a few of them can pull off a scam"
2020-08-23 08:36:50	xulfer	whoa whoa
2020-08-23 08:37:06	xulfer	I don't own shit.  i'm just another cog in the wheel
2020-08-23 08:37:17	paulguy	but you're OK with that relationship
2020-08-23 08:37:24	paulguy	you have no problem with it or how things are.
2020-08-23 08:37:28	xulfer	No i'm not
2020-08-23 08:37:41	xulfer	i don't like how things are
2020-08-23 08:37:47	kevr	so he should just stop doing what he's doing and do something else?
2020-08-23 08:37:51	kevr	like work in a deli or something?
2020-08-23 08:37:55	paulguy	you're readily able to just say "fuck them" when the system bites you and blame that individual, and not do anything about hte isutation.
2020-08-23 08:38:02	paulguy	kevr, no
2020-08-23 08:38:11	xulfer	i don't blame anyone
2020-08-23 08:38:18	paulguy	but yknow, actually be bothered by the situation and do _anything_ to change it.
2020-08-23 08:38:29	paulguy	but there are people to blame
2020-08-23 08:38:30	kevr	what would you have done if this happened to you, paul
2020-08-23 08:38:32	kevr	let's say
2020-08-23 08:38:38	kevr	you met some dude online that was super cool
2020-08-23 08:38:39	xulfer	okay paulguy  i'll bite... what do you want me to do?
2020-08-23 08:38:50	paulguy	yeah i'd be annoyed, but i should be rightfully annoyed at the situation at hand.
2020-08-23 08:38:53	kevr	then, you decided to contract with him on a job for some radio company
2020-08-23 08:38:53	ox	instupitious
2020-08-23 08:39:09	kevr	then, you did everything he was supposed to do for the job
2020-08-23 08:39:09	beest	being pro-worker does not mean calling random people on the internet dicks for no goddamn reason
2020-08-23 08:39:19	paulguy	beest, that isn't the point
2020-08-23 08:39:25	beest	this is not how you fight for justice, it's how you become an asshole on the internet
2020-08-23 08:39:31	kevr	for what he was supposed to do he was supposed to make 50%, or some kind of rate out of the thing
2020-08-23 08:39:39	kevr	so what, does he get.. 50% still?
2020-08-23 08:39:44	kevr	or.. 0%? or 25%?
2020-08-23 08:40:06	xulfer	i appreciate you guys speaking up for me... but i really wnt to know what paulguy  wants me to do
2020-08-23 08:40:09	paulguy	kevr, the point is that people shouldn't have to be stuck in the position where they have to pull scams to survive.
2020-08-23 08:40:12	ox	fight for justice long enough to see yourself turn into an asshole on the internet
2020-08-23 08:40:17	kevr	are we supposed to just tell him, hey man, you didn't do anything this time but here's your 12 grand for the month. next time, do better please!
2020-08-23 08:40:34	xulfer	you don't have to
2020-08-23 08:40:42	xulfer	you're good at what you do as i've said
2020-08-23 08:41:10	kevr	paulguy: yeah that does suck.. but how is it xulfer's responsibility to fight against that?
2020-08-23 08:41:12	paulguy	or get in to the habit of pulling scams to survive long past the need to survive because that's what their life has been since they've been born and have just made an awful habit of it.
2020-08-23 08:41:19	xulfer	i'm not keeping you down... hell i said earlier that i'd love to hire you
2020-08-23 08:41:29	paulguy	kevr, it's everyone's fucking responsibility to fight against that, otherwise it never changes.
2020-08-23 08:42:00	paulguy	we just accept it as a way to be and never bother doing anything about it
2020-08-23 08:42:04	xulfer	why are you against people?
2020-08-23 08:42:11	ox	they stink
2020-08-23 08:42:13	paulguy	and it just replicates itself
2020-08-23 08:42:39	xulfer	i can't please you
2020-08-23 08:42:44	kevr	that does suck about the world
2020-08-23 08:43:06	kevr	but the honest truth is, if you decide to be an activist against that, that's basically what you dedicate your life to
2020-08-23 08:43:07	paulguy	we're so used to be against each other and exploiting each other that we don't see ther ebeing any alternative and we just replay the same abuse over and over again over each generation.
2020-08-23 08:43:10	xulfer	i said i'd hire you, i said you were good, nothing in this whole chat has been negative against you
2020-08-23 08:43:14	kevr	you have work, then you have activism
2020-08-23 08:43:16	xulfer	yet you come after me
2020-08-23 08:43:18	kevr	then you have hours for sleep
2020-08-23 08:43:32	paulguy	xulfer, it's not about me
2020-08-23 08:43:47	xulfer	I know.  but it's become about me somehow
2020-08-23 08:43:54	kevr	then what are we supposed to do
2020-08-23 08:43:57	kevr	like
2020-08-23 08:43:59	xulfer	i didn't do anything wrong
2020-08-23 08:44:12	kevr	sacrifice our own income to be an activist against.. what exactly?
2020-08-23 08:44:23	kevr	i mean, the company is just asking for a task to be done
2020-08-23 08:44:50	xulfer	you come after ME when i said absolutely nothing against you and even praised you?
2020-08-23 08:44:59	paulguy	kevr, no.  people have to do some work to survive, that's just the reality, just don't accept the situation as it is and don't take your aggression out of people who are caught in the situation instead of those who actively create/reinforce the situation.
2020-08-23 08:44:59	ox	i wish i had a good coffee flavored vape right now
2020-08-23 08:45:17	beest	xulfer: welcome to paulguy
2020-08-23 08:45:18	xulfer	why am i the person that needs to be fucked?  because i said i have the capacity to hire someone?
2020-08-23 08:45:26	xulfer	i even said i would hire you
2020-08-23 08:45:36	beest	ox: i have never had a satisfactory coffee vape but will continue to seek
2020-08-23 08:45:40	ox	xulfer: you dont need to defend yourself 
2020-08-23 08:45:52	beest	ox: i want a vape that tastes like espresso jelly belly jelly beans
2020-08-23 08:45:53	paulguy	xulfer, again stop focusing on me.
2020-08-23 08:45:55	ox	beest: i havent had one since sub ohm tanks came out
2020-08-23 08:46:00	xulfer	ox: i do because i respect paulguy

2020-08-23 08:47:15	ox	beest: there was  one from a company called wicked wicks or something
2020-08-23 08:47:38	xulfer	why is everyone defending me.  I mean i like all of you guys but i think this has gone out of control
2020-08-23 08:47:41	beest	does it taste like bad muffins like everything else i've tried?
2020-08-23 08:47:43	xulfer	and i don't know why
2020-08-23 08:47:43	ox	all vape shops are the same anymore its hard to find unique stuff at a brick + mortar
2020-08-23 08:47:51	beest	xulfer: because this is routine
2020-08-23 08:47:58	kevr	same, i'm smoking some weed
2020-08-23 08:48:03	kevr	it's legal in california
2020-08-23 08:48:11	ox	no this one actually had a very good coffe flavor with a hint of what juice producers think is vanilla
2020-08-23 08:49:11	paulguy	beest is just in a similar position where he's a well paid professional worker where he benefits from there being workers below him who are more exploited and he wouldn't want to be in the position of a more exploited worker and sees him as being somehow superior to other people and wouldn't want to feel like he's on the same level as some average person like a trash collector or
2020-08-23 08:49:12	paulguy	cashier or something commonly seen as "low" work.
2020-08-23 08:49:13	beest	yeah the "vanilla substitute crafted from artificial sweeteners" flavour puts me off the most
2020-08-23 08:49:32	beest	i am?
2020-08-23 08:49:45	beest	i am highly mentally ill and in no one's employ
2020-08-23 08:49:54	ox	"...its just diluted custard they'll never know hah!"
2020-08-23 08:49:55	xulfer	paulguy: i just do interviews... i'm not really the boss
2020-08-23 08:49:58	beest	i realise you are prone to making ridiculous assumptions but that takes the cake
2020-08-23 08:49:58	paulguy	rather than building everyone up to being in a position of not being exploited but not feeling superior or like he's being rewarded as much for having earned better or something.
2020-08-23 08:50:21	ox	if you earned better you probably did better
2020-08-23 08:50:24	ox	so 
2020-08-23 08:50:26	xulfer	no one feels superior
2020-08-23 08:50:34	paulguy	many people feel superior
2020-08-23 08:50:43	xulfer	about what?
2020-08-23 08:50:44	paulguy	it's part of our culture to aim to feel superior
2020-08-23 08:50:52	xulfer	i don't
2020-08-23 08:50:59	xulfer	i come in here thinking we
2020-08-23 08:51:06	xulfer	are all the smae
2020-08-23 08:51:12	xulfer	same*
2020-08-23 08:51:12	ox	thats silly

2020-08-23 08:51:57	xulfer	do you think just because i know C probably better than anyone in here i feel superior?
2020-08-23 08:52:03	paulguy	yeah people aren't the same, but the differences don't matter nearly as much as we make them out to be, certainly nowhere near as much as we punish people for.
2020-08-23 08:52:13	xulfer	guess what 99% of people think rust is the big thing
2020-08-23 08:52:18	xulfer	it doesn't matter
2020-08-23 08:52:34	paulguy	people are different, and that should be totally OK, but it's not treated that way.

2020-08-23 08:56:26	xulfer	fucking hell... never make me the voice of reason again
2020-08-23 08:56:31	paulguy	I just want people to stop exploiting each other and people not being stuck in positions where they have to for their job or just out of a necessity to survive or because it's something they've learned or grown accustomed to doing, even beyond need.

2020-08-23 08:59:29	paulguy	xulfer, i know some don't want that, but to prevent a lot of preventable suffering and death, it's necessary for more and more people to try to do something about it. :/
2020-08-23 08:59:48	kevr	weed is great
2020-08-23 08:59:56	paulguy	and people to obviously do what they must for their survival, but not act like the situation is OK.

2020-08-23 09:12:29	kevr	nice
2020-08-23 09:12:37	paulguy	xulfer, i may be a bit grating and harsh but i'm just poor at expressing myself.  i don't hate you but i'm critical of some things you've said you've done and think they may indicative to harm to society as a whole. :/  There are likely people who can describe things better than I can, but I hope you get what I mean and don't just take it as something personal between you and me.
2020-08-23 09:12:37	ox	is that just battle chess
2020-08-23 09:12:40	kevr	oh damn thats badass
2020-08-23 09:12:59	th0rne	I don't want to spend 30 minutes only to find out that some video wasn't good.
2020-08-23 09:13:15	kevr	yeah its battlechess
2020-08-23 09:13:23	th0rne	I'd prefer for you to watch it first and tell me if it was good.
2020-08-23 09:13:24	paulguy	not that you're doing GREAT harm but yknow, contributing to it in some small way that is in line with the status quo
2020-08-23 09:13:30	xulfer	paulguy: i took no offense
2020-08-23 09:13:51	paulguy	mostly, i don't want you to take _personal_ offense, but not to just shrug it off.
2020-08-23 09:13:51	kevr	oh no, brutalchess
2020-08-23 09:14:14	xulfer	i read everything you say
2020-08-23 09:14:15	paulguy	what's that chess game for commodore 64 where the pieces start an action combat sequence?
2020-08-23 09:14:18	th0rne	This voltage current video seems pretty good.
2020-08-23 09:14:26	xulfer	but just don't get too worked up
2020-08-23 09:14:45	xulfer	battle chess i think
2020-08-23 09:15:03	paulguy	xulfer i get worked up because people suffer and die every day to exploitation and oppression and inequality, even when it's not covid season.
2020-08-23 09:15:14	paulguy	nah it's not battle chess.  I think that's an Amiga port or something.
2020-08-23 09:15:28	kevr	we're gonna have to have a chess showdown
2020-08-23 09:15:42	xulfer	was it on amiga?
2020-08-23 09:15:42	ox	how about a chest oil+rub down
2020-08-23 09:15:43	paulguy	or rather, there's a version for amiga where they have violent animations
2020-08-23 09:15:54	kevr	a choildown
2020-08-23 09:16:03	xulfer	where the queen and such would decap someone?

2020-08-23 09:16:25	kevr	ayyyeee
2020-08-23 09:16:44	paulguy	but there's a version for the commodore 64 where it actually becomes a combat sequence where even if in chess, it'd be a taken piece, if the piece to be taken won, it'd be the other way
2020-08-23 09:16:50	ox	perro como say de say boner ayee?

2020-08-23 14:54:01	co1ncidence	yeah lower resolutions are extremely undemanding
2020-08-23 14:54:17	deltasquared	low native resolution looks way better than low resolution upscaled I must say
2020-08-23 14:54:22	co1ncidence	i remember playing csgo on my rx5700xt at 480p and topping 900fps!
2020-08-23 14:54:39	co1ncidence	yeah upscaling is scuffed at best
2020-08-23 14:55:22	deltasquared	co1ncidence: coincidentally (ba-dum tssh), these hdmi modules have very simple display ICs, so overclocking them is trivial. the 480p one I can run at 120hz and the 272p at 180hz. somewhat impractical in the latter case lel
2020-08-23 14:55:36	co1ncidence	120hz!?
2020-08-23 14:55:40	deltasquared	well, technically the 480p I can push to 240hz
2020-08-23 14:55:41	deltasquared	but then
2020-08-23 14:55:42	co1ncidence	that's insane

2020-08-23 14:55:48	co1ncidence	oh yeah ofc but still
2020-08-23 14:55:53	co1ncidence	that must look so nice
2020-08-23 14:55:55	deltasquared	basically, it doesn't lose sync, it continues to *try* to display
2020-08-23 14:56:02	co1ncidence	playing a 480p game at that refresh rate
2020-08-23 14:56:04	deltasquared	but physics comes into play
2020-08-23 14:56:13	deltasquared	I suspect signal integrity issues
2020-08-23 14:56:23	deltasquared	I tried 300hz and got a lot of... colourful streaking
2020-08-23 14:56:40	deltasquared	even 240hz is not 100% stable on it
2020-08-23 14:56:56	co1ncidence	tbh I wouldn't know why you would need above 120hz lol
2020-08-23 14:57:01	co1ncidence	unless you are doing esports on there
2020-08-23 14:57:05	deltasquared	me neither.
2020-08-23 14:57:07	co1ncidence	lel
2020-08-23 14:57:21	deltasquared	funnily enough though, that 272p, it *has* to run at 180hz to be within the HDMI spec at all
2020-08-23 14:57:29	deltasquared	HDMI has a lower limit it turns out
2020-08-23 14:57:34	deltasquared	25Mpixels/sec
2020-08-23 14:57:46	co1ncidence	ah so if you went under there would be no output
2020-08-23 14:57:54	deltasquared	actually, you just can't
2020-08-23 14:57:58	deltasquared	linux won't let you
2020-08-23 14:57:59	co1ncidence	since the resolution is so low, you have to make up for it with framerate?
2020-08-23 14:58:12	deltasquared	basically.
2020-08-23 14:58:19	co1ncidence	ah that makes sense 
2020-08-23 14:58:43	deltasquared	if you didn't, the receiver could theoretically lose sync on the signal
2020-08-23 14:59:00	deltasquared	and it would just be like "I dunno all I see is noise"
2020-08-23 14:59:25	co1ncidence	i mean, we aren't complaining are we :P
2020-08-23 14:59:56	deltasquared	as it stands, on that 272p display, if you plug in the vsync/hsync sizes (which are larger than the active screen area) and the refresh rate (I had to mod the EDID even to put it at that rate), it's still only ~27MHz.
2020-08-23 15:00:09	deltasquared	it literally can't go any lower (and still be a nice multiple of standard framerates)

2020-08-23 15:12:15	co1ncidence	they take 10+ megabyte images with quality that doesn't nearly match the resolution the image is at
2020-08-23 15:12:25	deltasquared	a lot of it is trickery in newer phones, but they do have that point and shoot appeal.
2020-08-23 15:12:34	deltasquared	that old adage about the camera you have with you and so on.
2020-08-23 15:12:56	deltasquared	it's just if I need a proper tool to take images I'd rather... well, have a proper tool
2020-08-23 15:13:44	dreisner	being able to take a 10 megapixel shot with a sensor that small is nothing short of absurd. phone cameras aren't as good as manufacturers want you to believe they are (focusing on megapixels as a selling point) but they're still damn good given the constraints.

2020-08-23 15:16:54	Foxboron	dreisner: Phone camera sensors has seen the most development in recent years :p
2020-08-23 15:16:59	Foxboron	But I think it's all sony currently?
2020-08-23 15:17:19	co1ncidence	samsung's cameras have gotten the most improvement imo
2020-08-23 15:17:23	dreisner	i really wanted to wait for the pixel 5, but my 3's power button decided to start having opinions of its own.
2020-08-23 15:17:33	Foxboron	Lol samsung got nothing on sony. If anything they use sony sensors
2020-08-23 15:17:46	co1ncidence	pixel shmixel, phone is phone tbh
2020-08-23 15:18:48	Foxboron	dreisner: My Google Nexus 5 got into a boot loop when I was suppose to find my brother on Heathrow 🙃
2020-08-23 15:18:50	dreisner	i'm wondering if we'll ever start calling them by a different name. who the hell actually uses the "phone" function as the primary thing?
2020-08-23 15:18:51	Foxboron	that was a challenge
2020-08-23 15:18:59	HawkinsTheWizard	hmmm. whole day's trouble was fucking nvidia
2020-08-23 15:19:13	co1ncidence	just use amd :P
2020-08-23 15:19:18	deltasquared	HawkinsTheWizard: this surprises you? ;)
2020-08-23 15:19:47	HawkinsTheWizard	actually since fryday.  I could have had a nice weekend , but no. gotta have that sweet performance of an nvidia card.
2020-08-23 15:19:50	co1ncidence	dreisner: most call them smartphones now anyway
2020-08-23 15:19:54	deltasquared	it doesn't matter how stable it appears to be, binary modules from a vendor that doesn't want to play with the rest of the linux ecosystem are gonna bite you some day
2020-08-23 15:20:00	HawkinsTheWizard	yeah, swapped in the amd card, everything is working now
2020-08-23 15:20:03	dreisner	co1ncidence: still an anachronism.
2020-08-23 15:20:07	grawity	I had a nexus 5 until last year, then ordered a pixel 3a as replacement since it was just getting kinda slow and headphone jack was flaky
2020-08-23 15:20:17	deltasquared	Foxboron: how'd you fix it in the end
2020-08-23 15:20:21	grawity	the nexus 5 died literally the moment when the pixel 3a arrived
2020-08-23 15:20:27	Foxboron	deltasquared: I didn't
2020-08-23 15:20:30	deltasquared	grawity: "finally, my time has come"
2020-08-23 15:20:34	grawity	ikr
2020-08-23 15:20:34	Foxboron	But we landed at the same terminal :D
2020-08-23 15:20:40	HawkinsTheWizard	no, actually not the driver, that what I thought at first too, but seems like the actual hardware is borked
2020-08-23 15:20:44	co1ncidence	grapheneOS has been treating me well tbh
2020-08-23 15:20:48	co1ncidence	on the pixel 3a
2020-08-23 15:20:54	Foxboron	However, going to an EDM festival in London without a phone 5 friends is an INTERESTING challenge
2020-08-23 15:20:58	grawity	I answer the call from the parcel delivery dude, it still works
2020-08-23 15:21:01	Foxboron	What happens if you loose them among 20k people?
2020-08-23 15:21:03	Foxboron	NOBODY KNOWS
2020-08-23 15:21:17	grawity	I go outside to pick up, go back, its gpu is dead
2020-08-23 15:21:30	co1ncidence	:sadcat:
2020-08-23 15:21:33	Foxboron	grawity: planned obsolence
2020-08-23 15:21:42	Foxboron	Or rather... VERY WELL planned
2020-08-23 15:21:54	HawkinsTheWizard	your pixel 3a had a bigger penus

2020-08-23 15:25:05	co1ncidence	yeah it's fine no worries
2020-08-23 15:25:07	deltasquared	it didn't bother to process the image via rotation
2020-08-23 15:25:09	deltasquared	idk why
2020-08-23 15:25:22	co1ncidence	try another gallery app

2020-08-23 15:28:45	deltasquared	coincidentally, those pegs connecting the red bar of the screen frame allow for quick relase and swapping of the display module

2020-08-23 15:31:26	co1ncidence	just use a phoen as a trackpad or something
2020-08-23 15:31:59	deltasquared	aw crap, pinged a piece off

2020-08-23 15:35:42	deltasquared	the funny thing is I can actually seriously game on this thing if hooked up to suitably performant hardware. the steam controller's touchpads help a lot there.
2020-08-23 15:36:01	deltasquared	admittedly I've yet to play an FPS for long periods on it however.

A lot of the common programming environments were fairly light on timing stuff and games/interactive software seemed a bit of an afterthought, and documentation wouldn't've been anywhere near as available as it is today, so a lot of people probably just had no idea how to program a game for a system with proper timing without just having the computer

2020-08-23 20:12:44	paulguy	and it doesn't sound like dumb kid misunderstandings and thigns people grow out of, I'm guessing this person is an adult.

2020-08-23 20:13:54	xulfer	yeah she's an adult and even had the shit beat out of her
2020-08-23 20:14:03	paulguy	ah hmm
2020-08-23 20:14:04	xulfer	i wanted to comfort her
2020-08-23 20:14:24	xulfer	but nah im no big deal
2020-08-23 20:15:01	xulfer	she talked to my father on facebook and (yes i could tell) and just ignored me
2020-08-23 20:15:04	paulguy	i suppose one can give her a bit more benefit of doubt with respect to trust and whatnot.  Might see people trying to get close as a threat.
2020-08-23 20:15:14	xulfer	and i was like dude just fuck yourself
2020-08-23 20:15:17	paulguy	but yeah
2020-08-23 20:15:19	xulfer	i'm his first son
2020-08-23 20:15:27	paulguy	well, that shouldn't matter.
2020-08-23 20:15:34	xulfer	i know
2020-08-23 20:15:42	xulfer	but the fact that i'm his son should
2020-08-23 20:15:50	paulguy	why?
2020-08-23 20:16:13	paulguy	i mean, aside from you being their kid in general regardless of gender and that they at least have had some responsibility to care for you
2020-08-23 20:16:18	xulfer	because it means something?  why should a daughter matter more
2020-08-23 20:16:37	paulguy	why should it matter either way?
2020-08-23 20:16:38	xulfer	we're family
2020-08-23 20:17:06	paulguy	but yeah sometimes dads do get their "little angel" kinda thing, which is pretty selfish.
2020-08-23 20:17:16	dreisner	it shouldn't, but families are complicated. my wife is the youngest of 7, and her parents are divorced.
2020-08-23 20:17:27	paulguy	but it also goes the other way where sometimes the son is the prefered kid.
2020-08-23 20:18:03	xulfer	i don't want to be preferred
2020-08-23 20:18:07	paulguy	but it's just being irresponsible for people you're supposed to care for regardless who gets selected as the favorite
2020-08-23 20:18:08	xulfer	i just want to be a son
2020-08-23 20:18:29	xulfer	my father is just like you can go get fucked
2020-08-23 20:18:37	paulguy	ah.  it sounded like you were saying that being the son should make you the favorite.

2020-08-23 21:00:53	deltasquared	in the case of the macbooks in those vids it's often either ceramic caps or little inductors in the same form factor.
2020-08-23 21:01:10	mnrmnaugh	lol cyno as wood filler
2020-08-23 21:01:11	paulguy	that's just apple making things way too small hah
2020-08-23 21:01:11	deltasquared	didn't think ceramic caps were prone to failing short based on their construction...
2020-08-23 21:01:30	paulguy	eevblog made a video about ceramic cap failures
2020-08-23 21:01:35	paulguy	or at least, it might've been part of a mailbag.

2020-08-23 21:03:19	paulguy	deltasquared, you don't need to tkae it _all the way_, at leas tnot right away :p
2020-08-23 21:03:48	paulguy	but yeah ceramic caps are rigid devices made of layers of ceramic and metal foil, when they crack the foil layers can contact.
2020-08-23 21:03:50	deltasquared	regardless, I could already imagine the safety recalls
2020-08-23 21:03:59	deltasquared	I see.
2020-08-23 21:04:09	zaszi	deltasquared: sending it in for repairs and getting a "refurbished" model back
2020-08-23 21:04:17	zaszi	hard pass :D
2020-08-23 21:04:31	paulguy	i guess some companies make them a certain way where they maybe tend to crack in a particular way that avoids contact
2020-08-23 21:04:42	paulguy	not sure how that works, but it probably costs more :p

2020-08-23 21:07:41	deltasquared	what is it with the chinese, do they think grounds are superfluous?
2020-08-23 21:08:22	deltasquared	it always seems to be the cheap chinesium that mucks that up. I mean surely if you're peddling crap you at least want the suckers to stay alive long enough to buy your other crap

2020-08-23 21:09:29	paulguy	western so and so who contracts the thing to be made and sold wants every corner cut.  the few seconds it could take to attach the wire property is a few cents of cost per unit.
2020-08-23 21:09:35	+mpan	Do you know how many cents a piece of wire costs?! ;)
2020-08-23 21:09:57	jelle	1 cent
2020-08-23 21:10:18	+mpan	Only if it’s 1-cent worth pice of wire.
2020-08-23 21:10:22	jelle	:D
2020-08-23 21:10:46	paulguy	but yeah if you're paying bottom dollar, expect bottom quality.  you can only make certain things so cheap when they're being made by people. :p

2020-08-25 08:19:41	paulguy	queeery
2020-08-25 08:20:58	homerj	but that went from something that a few people went "who's going to use this" to "this is part of an upgrade to run thie"

2020-08-25 15:40:59	deltasquared	C++ tip of the day: if you really do have a legit need to make another variant of a class that's not much cleaner as a template, at least remember to change constructor names as well as the class name if they're similar. otherwise the compiler gets extremely confused and thinks they're deduction guides (!?).
2020-08-25 15:41:19	deltasquared	(by make another variant I mean copy-paste it. again, if a template would not work.)
2020-08-25 15:42:07	+mpan	The counter of Source codes broken by copy-paste has just went up by 1.
2020-08-25 15:42:39	deltasquared	internally had a panic before realising this was one of those dumb language features where they made a potential bad habit cause an entirely confusing and seemingly unrelated error because the committee is allergic to new keywords.
2020-08-25 15:44:01	deltasquared	so they instead thought "why not introduce this feature by using constructor syntax, but with a name different to the containing class? because obviously all C++ programmers are perfect and compiler warnings can't possibly be misleading!"
2020-08-25 15:44:22	deltasquared	mpan: anyway, before you ask about head implosions, I'm sorta trying to invoke that intentionally today

2020-08-25 15:45:44	deltasquared	anyhow, battering my head against C++ will do just fine
2020-08-25 15:45:48	+mpan	deltasquared: keywords can’t be easily added without breaking existing code or being awkward (read: starting with an underscore).
2020-08-25 15:46:08	deltasquared	mpan: I know. I didn't say their "allergy" (aka avoidance) of them was irrational.
2020-08-25 15:46:20	+mpan	Oh, I took that as a criticism. Fine.
2020-08-25 15:46:32	deltasquared	it just makes for a lot of language features that seem confusingly and/or dangerously implemented at first
2020-08-25 15:46:47	deltasquared	I mean they're still sorta dangerous, it's just about how much time it takes for you to realise the fuck-up

2020-08-26 14:03:51	xulfer	deltasquared: doctors are like that sometimes
2020-08-26 14:04:05	deltasquared	nothing else constricted it looks like.
2020-08-26 14:04:14	deltasquared	mild sinusitis...? o.o
2020-08-26 14:04:26	xulfer	My neuro is the head neuro add the hospital i go to... he had a student in there and said to her... 'Oh look an angioma'... i was like 'WHAT!'
2020-08-26 14:04:31	xulfer	turns out it's no big deal
2020-08-26 14:04:33	xulfer	but still
2020-08-26 14:05:13	deltasquared	*mild* sinusitis, the doc mentioned that, said it would not be particularly relevant given the magnitude of discomfort I have experienced. he has a stronger hypothesis anyhow.
2020-08-26 14:05:20	deltasquared	"the orbits are normal".
2020-08-26 14:05:23	deltasquared	???
2020-08-26 14:05:32	xulfer	lol
2020-08-26 14:05:34	deltasquared	that's literally one line on it's own, dafuq
2020-08-26 14:06:16	deltasquared	oh, apparently that's to do with the scan itself.
2020-08-26 14:06:21	xulfer	i didn't realize sinusitis would show on an MRI... but i guess it makes sense
2020-08-26 14:06:31	deltasquared	so I guess that means I kept my head still enough
2020-08-26 14:06:56	deltasquared	orbit was referring to the motion of the scan fields about my head apparently.
2020-08-26 14:07:26	deltasquared	right, in the "head case" folder it goes lol
2020-08-26 14:10:02	mogad0n	haavard 
2020-08-26 14:10:07	mogad0n	is this your work
2020-08-26 14:10:11	mogad0n	https://github.com/haavard/tox-weechat

2020-08-26 14:10:22	deltasquared	mpan: anyway, short version of scan results, they spotted some minor things while they just happened to be looking but doc's interpretation is overall no indication of anything head implosion related.
2020-08-26 14:10:26	mogad0n	i can only assume yes
2020-08-26 14:10:40	deltasquared	mogad0n: hey now, usernames aren't globally unique... ;)
2020-08-26 14:10:54	mogad0n	true but weechat archlinux
2020-08-26 14:10:58	mogad0n	tox
2020-08-26 14:10:59	mogad0n	idk
2020-08-26 14:11:02	mogad0n	heh
2020-08-26 14:11:25	deltasquared	ugh, speaking of head implosions... back later :S
2020-08-26 14:11:26	mogad0n	ah it seems so
2020-08-26 14:11:28	jelle	deltasquared: it is in this case lol
2020-08-26 14:11:34	mogad0n	haavard ++
2020-08-26 14:11:39	mogad0n	thanks for the work
2020-08-26 14:12:22	mogad0n	manjaro still good though /s

2020-08-26 14:31:13	+mpan	I wanted to check prices of USB audio dongles. One of the first things that caught my eye was some discussion on some forum in which someone claims USB is noisy because it was not deigned for audio, but is computer interface. :|

2020-08-26 14:32:07	deltasquared	mpan: ground isolation probably matters. a properly designed USB DAC will be built to eliminate that
2020-08-26 14:32:21	-->	greek_soon (~Thunderbi@116.30.220.75) has joined #archlinux-offtopic
2020-08-26 14:32:30	deltasquared	laptops get to cheat somewhat in that regard as they have an inbuilt "ground lift": disconnect the AC power. only for a while of course :P
2020-08-26 14:32:55	+mpan	But the same is true for any audio card.
2020-08-26 14:33:12	deltasquared	mpan: right, so the thing to check is reviews from people who know what they're on about ;)
2020-08-26 14:33:31	+mpan	:]
2020-08-26 14:33:53	+mpan	!check if mpan should cause deltasquared head implosions to see if the new treatment works
2020-08-26 14:33:54	phrik	Testing if mpan should cause deltasquared head implosions to see if the new treatment works: [PANIC]
2020-08-26 14:34:02	+mpan	!check if phrik’s head imploded
2020-08-26 14:34:02	deltasquared	if you were paranoid, you could get a USB toslink transmitter and something taking toslink the othere end for the DAC
2020-08-26 14:34:03	phrik	Testing if phrik’s head imploded: [FAIL]
2020-08-26 14:34:09	deltasquared	mpan: I haven't got the stuffz yet
2020-08-26 14:34:29	deltasquared	anyway, because toslink is digital to digital, there's no chance for interference to creep in on the link
2020-08-26 14:34:38	deltasquared	then all you'd have to worry about was the DAC's design itself
2020-08-26 14:35:08	deltasquared	there *is* science to it, but I'd be inclined to call anyone claiming USB is intrinsically noisy as full of shit.
2020-08-26 14:35:09	+mpan	Yeah, but PCIE or integrated audio devices have the same problems. :)
2020-08-26 14:35:22	+mpan	But yeah, it is about noise being in USB itself. 
2020-08-26 14:36:37	+mpan	There may be some noise from digital switching itself, true. But it is in hundreds kilohertz to megahertz range. Easily filtered out (not to mention: not perceptible to human ear directly).
2020-08-26 14:37:46	+mpan	If anything, I would be afraid of the output amplifier being incapable of delivering full power at full range. Or something like that.
2020-08-26 14:38:36	+mpan	Power parts is what one would save dollars on. Not filtering.

2020-08-26 18:59:31	pulec	own mail server and all included, right?
2020-08-26 18:59:49	deltasquared	not quite. drop appropriately formatted raw email into folder, have some mail daemon relay it to my regular email provider via SMTP.
2020-08-26 18:59:58	deltasquared	you can't get around the reputation problem any more
2020-08-26 19:00:08	deltasquared	email sender reputation has become a walled garden.
2020-08-26 19:00:58	deltasquared	even my main provider for years, formerly 1and1 (now ionos, apparently) gets errors about reputation sometimes when I tried sending from there. it's rare so far but it's not a good sign.
2020-08-26 19:02:04	deltasquared	I recently tried to send a mail to paypal's phishing reporting address for instance. while I'm not overly fond of them, I still try to report spam senders.
2020-08-26 19:02:21	deltasquared	lo and behold the forwarded message gets rejected saying the sender has too low a reputation.
2020-08-26 19:03:25	deltasquared	and that's supposedly a big web hosting company. (ionos's main business is one of those website builder things)
2020-08-26 19:05:26	deltasquared	pulec: so the short version of it is while having one's own mail server would be nice, it's no longer feasible. for recieving it'd get mercilessly pelted with spam, and for sending it's of no use because nobody is interested in listening if you're not an entrenched big player on the internet.
2020-08-26 19:05:41	deltasquared	I have to settle for having a provider acting as a "credibility relay"
2020-08-26 19:06:37	pulec	oh yeah somebody talked about the mail reputation issue, thats sick
2020-08-26 19:06:41	deltasquared	so, something like offlineimap to sync mail to local maildir, then... not sure about the sending component yet.
2020-08-26 19:06:54	pulec	mail daemon relay then, simpler, don't care about the rest
2020-08-26 19:08:02	deltasquared	the file format is at least pretty easy to work with. mime-encoding can get a little messy but there are existing tools to read such messages once you already have them.

2020-08-26 19:32:19	deltasquared	I could not rationalise why I was stealing at the time, I used to have problems finding the words.

2020-08-26 19:48:56	deltasquared	re: why, well because family is more important than some court case for starters surely? also no need to be in an enclosed space either if you're at particular risk.

2020-08-26 19:53:12	xulfer	and according to the letter i got i'm a little worried because somehow i'm going to have to provide documentation that i'm suceptible?
2020-08-26 19:53:32	xulfer	like i need to mail them a doctors note saying i smoke, and drink a ton, and help my grandparents?

2020-09-01 13:29:10	deltasquared	yeah, it's not /all/ the time that they are marked as "distupgrade only"

2020-09-01 13:30:06	deltasquared	I don't know the specifics of how and when such packages are marked. I've observed it happening on an ubuntu system. in that case it does seem to be that most of the time kernel updates are dist-upgrade.
2020-09-01 13:30:33	kevr	indeed
2020-09-01 13:30:39	kevr	happens on debian itself, too

2020-09-01 13:31:56	grawity	debian also tries to keep kernel abi compatibility, so your modules remain compatible for quite a few versions
2020-09-01 13:32:16	grawity	and you only get a new package when the abi finally has to change
2020-09-01 13:32:23	th0rne	What's abi?
2020-09-01 13:32:32	deltasquared	demize: oh yeah, I forget they pull that stunt. they upgrade the "meta" package which then pulls a different named actual kernel package.
2020-09-01 13:32:45	grawity	binary interface (function parameter types and sizes and shapes, etc.)
2020-09-01 13:33:06	th0rne	I see.
2020-09-01 13:33:23	deltasquared	th0rne: usually it means *application* binary interface, but such a concept exists for inside the kernel too.
2020-09-01 13:33:31	grawity	a big reason why you can't usually load kernel X modules on kernel Y is a safeguard in case the same function suddenly has different parameters
2020-09-01 13:33:44	grawity	so the module calls it and everything gets misinterpreted
2020-09-01 13:33:55	deltasquared	you're off to undefined behaviour land, have a nice day!
2020-09-01 13:34:18	grawity	(sometimes you *can* `insmod -f` an older or newer module, if you really really don't want to reboot, but it gets more risky the bigger the version gap)
2020-09-01 13:34:35	th0rne	Risky in what sense?
2020-09-01 13:34:45	deltasquared	more risk of crashes, data corruption, etc.
2020-09-01 13:35:01	th0rne	Ok.
2020-09-01 13:35:04	grawity	if you're lucky it can crash, if you're unlucky it can silently destroy something
2020-09-01 13:35:07	deltasquared	if you do that on a production system you probably deserve the consequences of whoever gets angry about it.
2020-09-01 13:35:16	deltasquared	consequences/wrath
2020-09-01 13:35:33	deltasquared	grawity: there's a taint flag for that right?
2020-09-01 13:35:38	th0rne	Btw, if you install a new kernel and don't reboot for days, is that safe?
2020-09-01 13:35:40	grawity	whereas in debian, as long as the kernel is packaged in e.g. linux-4.19.0-5, you can keep getting new versions of that, and the new modules still remain compatible with your currently running kernel from 4.19.0-5
2020-09-01 13:35:44	th0rne	On arch.
2020-09-01 13:35:52	rcf	The kernel people themselves take some degree of pride in breaking compatibility.
2020-09-01 13:35:53	th0rne	Sorry for ontopic.
2020-09-01 13:36:04	grawity	th0rne: it's safe, you just won't be able to load drivers in case you connect some new usb thing
2020-09-01 13:36:06	rcf	th0rne: its fine, the modules are versioned 
2020-09-01 13:36:07	grawity	deltasquared: yeah I think there is
2020-09-01 13:36:10	th0rne	Rught, ok.
2020-09-01 13:36:19	th0rne	*Right
2020-09-01 13:36:19	th0rne	Thanks.
2020-09-01 13:36:28	zaszi	th0rne: note that you also miss out on security fixes if you do not reboot

2020-09-01 13:36:35	grawity	th0rne: it won't even *try* to load modules from the wrong version as they're in a different directory
2020-09-01 13:36:35	zaszi	which may or may not be relevant for you
2020-09-01 13:36:47	grawity	th0rne: we're just mainly talking about *why* they are in a different directory every time

2020-09-01 13:37:37	deltasquared	re: the kernel upgrade thing on arch
2020-09-01 13:37:55	deltasquared	now the vmlinux binary is stored in the modules dir...
2020-09-01 13:38:01	deltasquared	I just mark linux NoUpgrade
2020-09-01 13:38:06	deltasquared	so I can keep a few old versions back
2020-09-01 13:38:14	deltasquared	I then manually prune them every now and again
2020-09-01 13:38:31	grawity	wait, NoUpgrade or IgnorePkg?
2020-09-01 13:38:37	deltasquared	note, that still makes it extract, it just doesn't remove the old files
2020-09-01 13:38:50	deltasquared	grawity: it /is/ NoUpgrade that leaves old files intact right? hold on lemme check my config
2020-09-01 13:38:53	grawity	how does that work
2020-09-01 13:38:58	th0rne	zaszi: Ok, noted.
2020-09-01 13:38:59	deltasquared	one moment...
2020-09-01 13:39:03	grawity	ah right, I guess it applies to removal as well
2020-09-01 13:39:08	grawity	I thought it only prevented replacement with a new version
2020-09-01 13:39:24	deltasquared	erm, not package selection, but by file match sorry
2020-09-01 13:39:25	deltasquared	NoUpgrade = usr/lib/modules/*.*.*
2020-09-01 13:39:41	demize	It's not the best named option out there, no.
2020-09-01 13:39:52	demize	NoUpgrade doesn't even sound like it should work on files to me.  :p
2020-09-01 13:39:58	deltasquared	tell me about it
2020-09-01 13:40:10	grawity	you mean it's the same "upgrade to nothing is still upgrade" pedantry that requires you to use usr/lib instead of /usr/lib
2020-09-01 13:40:15	zaszi	deltasquared: does this matter if you have a package cache? Or am I missing something here with your approach?
2020-09-01 13:40:25	deltasquared	anyhow, I have that so I can upgrade the kernel then reboot at my convenience without worrying about some usb module failing to load until I reboot
2020-09-01 13:40:41	demize	grawity: Indeed.
2020-09-01 13:40:44	grawity	package cache requires you to manually -U an old kernel, wait for initramfs to rebuild (--noscriptlet does not work for hooks), load the modules, then upgrade again
2020-09-01 13:41:00	zaszi	oh, I see now
2020-09-01 13:41:06	deltasquared	zaszi: they can exist orthogonally
2020-09-01 13:41:12	deltasquared	my approach just keeps the files on disk ready to go
2020-09-01 13:41:25	demize	grawity: I wonder if specifying a different --hookdir would work for that.
2020-09-01 13:41:26	sheep	has there been any more thought to having separate packages for each kernel version?
2020-09-01 13:41:26	grawity	oh and don't forget dkms modules, it takes ages to build openafs on my potato server ._.
2020-09-01 13:41:34	deltasquared	specifically, it keeps the current version's modules around while I am still on that kernel
2020-09-01 13:42:04	zaszi	my approach has usually been upgrade, reboot, cry as it no longer works
2020-09-01 13:42:09	deltasquared	grawity: I found the dkms trigger to run far too often, I got suitably annoyed with it that I yeeted the one (not very important) dkms module I had
2020-09-01 13:44:16	deltasquared	zaszi: if you're willing to manually remove old kernel versions when you don't need them and keep an eye on your disk space, that line I wrote above ought to do the trick.
2020-09-01 13:44:27	deltasquared	use it at your own peril of course, but so far...
2020-09-01 13:44:29	deltasquared	!worksforme
2020-09-01 13:44:30	phrik	you're doing it wrong

2020-09-01 13:44:49	deltasquared	that was not quite appropriate for that context but oh well xD

2020-09-01 13:45:00	phrik	grawity: Is that… Is that really a word?
2020-09-01 13:46:30	zaszi	deltasquared: I rely on just the package cache these days, and prune it automatically with the paccache timer and service
2020-09-01 13:46:53	zaszi	usually I have one breakage every 6m-1y, which tends to take 5min into a live usb boot to fix
2020-09-01 13:47:14	zaszi	PAM was the latest one, last year it was a kernel regression breaking boot so I just rolled back with the package cache
2020-09-01 13:47:48	zaszi	I do usually update and reboot all my machines once a week, though
2020-09-01 13:47:57	MrElendig	the cache would not save you from the pam one
2020-09-01 13:48:06	deltasquared	right, because ENOLOGIN
2020-09-01 13:48:10	MrElendig	(and it was fixable wihtout booting the install image)
2020-09-01 13:48:21	deltasquared	MrElendig: break=postmount to the rescue?

2020-09-01 13:48:44	zaszi	MrElendig: properly checking the pacnew instead of reboot without looking... TWICE, would have :P
2020-09-01 13:48:52	MrElendig	that too
2020-09-01 13:49:06	zaszi	but yeah, boot live usb, decrypt and mount disk, remove old pam config and replace it with new one

Contact hell ensued of trying to figure out when they were going to connect it to my apartment. Apparently the ISP hired a company that subcontracted it further, and they had no idea when they would put it down, it could be within a month, or take multiple months.
2020-09-01 14:10:40	grawity	I switched from ADSL to 4G last month, gained speed but lost stability and lost static IP address

2020-09-01 14:14:41	MrElendig	best thing: the reason for why they signed up for cable instead of mandating fiber in the new contract was totally not because the people in the comitee for the appartment block got free internet

2020-09-01 16:37:49	MrElendig	amd doesn't really have a useable laptop dgpu
2020-09-01 16:37:49	kevr	yeah they do i think, but

2020-09-01 16:38:09	deltasquared	MrElendig: that said, the way their APUs are going perhaps eventually the secondary gpu won't be necessary.
2020-09-01 16:38:15	deltasquared	one can only hope
2020-09-01 16:38:20	kevr	the firmware stuff they do for the shipped with vendor is all under NDA, but they do have open firmware, that i haven't yet switched to
2020-09-01 16:38:23	MrElendig	or sold with higher price and lower spec than the same laptop just with a nvidia card
2020-09-01 16:39:03	MrElendig	deltasquared: depends, apu will forever be ram starved, unless we start sticking a 16gb of fast hbm2 directly to it

2020-09-01 16:39:18	kevr	but i dont give a shit if it's under nda, we can find out how to do this
2020-09-01 16:39:20	MrElendig	deltasquared: that is why amd are not adding more CUs to their apis
2020-09-01 16:39:24	MrElendig	apu's
2020-09-01 16:39:27	kevr	otherwise i'm gonna go ape shit
2020-09-01 16:39:34	MrElendig	won't do all that much due to being ram starved
2020-09-01 16:39:37	kevr	because it's just some hardware
2020-09-01 16:39:49	MrElendig	there is also the cooling and size issue
2020-09-01 16:40:11	kevr	i wonder if i can just figure out how to modify the stub they create to continue loading into the arch kernel
2020-09-01 16:40:14	deltasquared	MrElendig: you know, that wouldn't even be that dumb at first glance were it not for power and thermal constraints. the CPU could certainly make use of that too, considering most of what it will be doing is load/store of entire cache lines.
2020-09-01 16:40:34	deltasquared	agree though that'd be a big die
2020-09-01 16:40:37	MrElendig	deltasquared: intel has it on their roadmap
2020-09-01 16:40:44	deltasquared	what, integrated hbm2?
2020-09-01 16:40:48	MrElendig	yes
2020-09-01 16:41:03	MrElendig	but only for datacenter stuff
2020-09-01 16:41:50	MrElendig	part of their foveros plan
2020-09-01 16:41:59	deltasquared	ah, that figures. they're managing to get a hang of the mixed process dies now (was that lakefield with the big-little arch that had that?) so I guess it would not be too far fetched.
2020-09-01 16:43:11	MrElendig	they showed a mockup of cpu + fpga + hbm2 stack

2020-09-01 17:28:26	deltasquared	MrElendig: it'd be another way for them to gimp their cheaper cpus like the celerons. mediocre amount of non-replaceable memory, probably only in a single channel equivalent configuration to boot
2020-09-01 17:29:02	MrElendig	they already gimp them with artificial ram limits anyway
2020-09-01 17:29:07	MrElendig	no difference there
2020-09-01 17:29:25	MrElendig	also this is for laptops which generally doesn't have replacable ram anymore anyway

2020-09-01 17:37:42	+mpan	And people washing hands, keeping distance, not coughing, not going to wokrplace/school if feeling ill etc. practically eradicated this year’s flu in Australia.

2020-09-01 17:38:00	+mpan	It was totally expected, but nice to see actual data that confirms it.

2020-09-01 17:38:58	+mpan	Just like Covid affects everyone. The age/health distribution is not equal for either of those, but it’s not exclusive to some group. Even you can acquire and die of either Covid or seasonal flu.
2020-09-01 17:39:30	jelle	mpan: you totally misunderstand me
2020-09-01 17:39:33	jelle	so pls 
2020-09-01 17:39:40	+mpan	Yes, there most of the distribution for both diseases is for people of relatively poor health to start with, but you shouldn’t feel safe.

2020-09-01 17:59:33	deltasquared	alwyn: well most ISOs don't contain any modifiable filesystems afterwards
2020-09-01 17:59:37	deltasquared	so that's not really possible
2020-09-01 17:59:43	nh	cd9600 ftw

2020-09-01 18:00:19	deltasquared	so the tool would have to be bootloader aware

2020-09-01 18:01:05	kevr	let's see!
2020-09-01 18:01:40	deltasquared	alwyn: you can certainly dd it to a USB if it's a hybrid, but that direct method is just copying a filesystem (usely iso9660) that is finalised and not designed to be modified after.
2020-09-01 18:01:49	jelle	these guys are monkeys
2020-09-01 18:01:53	deltasquared	the more clever tools detect the distro and apply special casing

2020-09-01 18:02:47	alwyn	it started off alright but daaaamn he went offtrack
2020-09-01 18:02:49	Foxboron	I still think it was hillarious when someone on FOSDEM called for the subreddit to be burned when we had the improvised devroom :D
2020-09-01 18:03:03	deltasquared	alwyn: for instance, the tool might detect it's using isolinux as the bootloader, in which case all you'd have to do in theory is create a fat32 partition, copy the files over (as the actual installer image is a nested squashfs usually), then use syslinux which reads the same config files but boots from / can read fat partitions
2020-09-01 18:03:05	Foxboron	alwyn: The first sentence was almost a good burn attempt, but it really fell through the second act
2020-09-01 18:03:10	Foxboron	This isn't even 4chan good

2020-09-01 18:04:10	deltasquared	alwyn: so basically it depends on how the "live usb maker" tool decides to work.
2020-09-01 18:04:14	zaszi	Foxboron: curse you for diluting the glorious arch elitism with these dirty ubuntu peasants!
2020-09-01 18:04:26	alwyn	fair

2020-09-01 18:05:03	deltasquared	alwyn: bearing in mind that a lot of the time it's still a nested squashfs image that holds the actual system that boots from the CD, so you're screwed a second time if you want to modify the innards of that
2020-09-01 18:05:33	alwyn	deltasquared: I get your point, and that is not what I'm wanting to achieve :)
2020-09-01 18:05:36	zaszi	it's shit like this why I cba with social media tbh

2020-09-01 18:05:59	Foxboron	zaszi: IRC is social media :p
2020-09-01 18:06:00	deltasquared	alwyn: very well, so elaborate? did you just want some leftover space you can use normally?
2020-09-01 18:06:06	Foxboron	argueably before the invention of the term social media
2020-09-01 18:06:07	nh	alwyn why not extract the iso, make some changes then reiso it and burn that
2020-09-01 18:06:31	deltasquared	nh: at that point they might as well do a portable USB install then grab the packages the distro uses for their installer gui
2020-09-01 18:06:40	zaszi	Foxboron: while there's some truth in the tecnicality of that definition, you can't really compare IRC to the usual suspects
2020-09-01 18:06:40	jelle	nh: oof
2020-09-01 18:07:13	Foxboron	zaszi: IRC isn't facebook/twitter/discord trash. But that is mostly due to the barrier of entry.
2020-09-01 18:07:16	alwyn	deltasquared: correct, usable leftover space
2020-09-01 18:07:19	Foxboron	But I'll still argue it is social media
2020-09-01 18:08:03	seankhliao	IRC is not much different from the whatsapp/telegram/... messenger groups
2020-09-01 18:08:35	zaszi	Foxboron: ye, the barrier of entry and weaning popularity makes it tolerable. I'd argue it's also a lot more "opt-in" than most other platforms
2020-09-01 18:08:48	deltasquared	alwyn: in that case, I'd just create an extra partition. idk if windows will see that though. windows only looks for one valid partition on "removeable" drives.
2020-09-01 18:08:50	Foxboron	indeed
2020-09-01 18:08:55	zaszi	and it's my only one. Living a happier life without Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc..
2020-09-01 18:09:02	Foxboron	A few more years and this chat moves to discord
2020-09-01 18:09:05	Foxboron	and we'll all be happy
2020-09-01 18:09:18	seankhliao	noooo!
2020-09-01 18:09:19	zaszi	if anything I hope it would be Matrix
2020-09-01 18:09:24	zaszi	Discord is a flaming heap of trash
2020-09-01 18:09:48	deltasquared	alwyn: _in theory_ if you mucked about with the partition table a bit you could change the types of the install image partitions. windows won't touch EFI boot partitions and the linux initrds for live ISOs only look for volumes by name, not partition type.
2020-09-01 18:09:57	deltasquared	then you create a regular partition in the spare area
2020-09-01 18:10:05	deltasquared	and use that for day to day stuffz

2020-09-01 18:13:37	alwyn	zaszi: I dunno man, I find Discord is pretty great
2020-09-01 18:14:35	Foxboron	alwyn: they have taken VC money. They are dead in the water because of it.
2020-09-01 18:14:48	alwyn	VC?
2020-09-01 18:14:49	zaszi	alwyn: iffy voice servers, dropped calls, feature creep, centralized, can't self-host, suddenly also a game store
2020-09-01 18:14:55	Foxboron	alwyn: Venture Capital
2020-09-01 18:14:58	alwyn	ah
2020-09-01 18:15:11	zaszi	they're not even a good VoIP client
2020-09-01 18:15:13	alwyn	I agree from those aspects
2020-09-01 18:15:21	alwyn	Well, most of them
2020-09-01 18:15:25	zaszi	you'd think they'd get at least that part right
2020-09-01 18:15:34	alwyn	But the communities people can people on them are great
2020-09-01 18:15:34	Foxboron	The investors are going to demand pretty much yearly growth, and discord is going to struggle finding monetization 
2020-09-01 18:15:51	alwyn	And VoIP definitely isn't perfect it's definitely good enough, even in large group settings
2020-09-01 18:15:56	Foxboron	So thus you are see the shit with nitro, emoji restrictions etc.

2020-09-01 18:18:37	alwyn	You bring up good arguments, but also completely disregard the fact that many many many people have built amazing communities on the platform
2020-09-01 18:20:33	seankhliao	but this new generation of communities are more topic based rather than people based, so easier to move to a different platform
2020-09-01 18:20:44	seankhliao	compared to say facebook
2020-09-01 18:21:30	alwyn	While yes, all those different topics all have different communities in discord as well
2020-09-01 18:21:44	alwyn	So it's easy to hop from one to another without having to change platforms
2020-09-01 18:22:02	alwyn	I am not saying this in defense of, just stating how it is
2020-09-01 18:36:43	deltasquared	huh, apparently ${foo: -4} and ${foo:-4} do two different things. the bash manual for var operations is confusing :/

2020-09-02 17:47:28	pulec	but isn't all communication public then?
2020-09-02 17:47:28	deltasquared	great, today is one of those days where I'm afraid to do anything useful in case of head implosions...
2020-09-02 17:47:53	pulec	still compare that to a nutoriously complex tickey system, simplicity wins
2020-09-02 17:48:08	pulec	deltasquared: then its a chill day, chill out!
2020-09-02 17:48:29	deltasquared	pulec: I guess. but I can't even do things like watch a movie. that will also trigger implosion, just more slowly.
2020-09-02 17:48:57	+mpan	pulec: yes, it is. But most customers ask questions that are answered in FAQ, public releases or are basic knowledge anyway. And the angry ones are likely to go public to bring the thing up. So not a problem.

2020-09-02 18:01:57	deltasquared	eh, guess it can wait till tomorrow to fix.

2020-09-02 18:07:30	deltasquared	had to manually patch and reboot, but it did seem to be working up to a point - 90hz was stable for instance (I'm running that now)
2020-09-02 18:07:42	deltasquared	I decided "fuck it" and tried 120hz

2020-09-02 18:09:28	deltasquared	thankfully no permanent damage appears to have been done. the backlight came on but no screen data. I can only guess something simply refused to go that fast or lost sync of the signal trying to do so.
2020-09-02 18:10:06	Namarrgon	apply more voltage, that always works
2020-09-02 18:11:18	deltasquared	scorecard so far, one display that does 90, another doing 120, yet another doing 180...

2020-09-02 18:12:52	deltasquared	going further than that for each one respectively yielded a black screen, extreme screen corruption (crosstalk?), and the screen getting progressively whiter until it became solid (suggesting unwanted signal path inductance preventing the signals from toggling fast enough)

2020-09-04 00:09:58	paulguy	well, it seems to be a thing a lot of things are called
2020-09-04 00:10:07	yakubin	oh.
2020-09-04 00:10:11	yakubin	it sounds italian.
2020-09-04 00:10:18	paulguy	ah
2020-09-04 00:11:01	paulguy	then there's allegra which is some kind of medication or something
2020-09-04 00:11:41	yakubin	and sure enough it is italian, as all things musical: > Allegro – fast, quick, and bright (120–156 bpm) (molto allegro is slightly faster than allegro, but always in its range; 124-156 bpm)
2020-09-04 00:12:08	paulguy	heh i should've probably known that haha
2020-09-04 00:12:30	+mpan	yakubin: and now Allegro nags paulguy with the GDPR nag screen.
2020-09-04 00:12:38	paulguy	i didn't click on it :p
2020-09-04 00:12:43	+mpan	Yes, they do that to non-EU addresses too.
2020-09-04 00:12:46	paulguy	i figured it was in polish and i wouldn't be able to read it.
2020-09-04 00:13:43	paulguy	youtube recommended me a get stick bugged meme on my phone.

2020-09-04 00:15:01	yakubin	mpan: shipping: inpost - it's theirs.
2020-09-04 00:15:17	+mpan	yakubin: yes, but not a single brand.
2020-09-04 00:15:50	paulguy	i wonder if europe's used guitars market gets particularly unique guitars relative to the US.

2020-09-04 00:18:21	nh	but yes most guitars were designed in america in like the 50s and are made in indonesia and korea
2020-09-04 00:18:34	nh	hofner made the paul mcartney viola bass
2020-09-04 00:18:41	paulguy	interesting

2020-09-04 00:20:06	yakubin	aesthetically, i like ibanezes.
2020-09-04 00:20:19	paulguy	yeah ibanezes do tend to look nice
2020-09-04 00:20:25	deltasquared	welp, first night on 2 tablets instead of one for $headdrugs. naturally my tongue's gone numb again because I wasn't fast enough to take both of them
2020-09-04 00:20:28	yakubin	and also sound lively.
2020-09-04 00:20:30	paulguy	and i'm sure they'er fine musically.
2020-09-04 00:20:35	yakubin	they use good wood i think.
2020-09-04 00:22:06	paulguy	now that nobody's home but the neighbors I probably should practice.
2020-09-04 00:23:07	beest	paulguy: there is one anomaly in europe that you don't see quite as much of in the US, they tend to see a few more guitars floating around intended for the japanese domestic market
2020-09-04 00:23:08	paulguy	rocksmith seems to have gotten a bit more fragile in that when it loses focus its audio breaks until it's restarted, and latency seems ot have gotten a little worse. :/
2020-09-04 00:23:37	paulguy	beest, interesting.  yeah I guess Japan has a lot of their own specific guitars.
2020-09-04 00:23:43	deltasquared	so I'm sat up in bed, laptop is acting as a sort of thin client over ethernet to the machine running irssi... every time I press a key the ethernet lights blink naturally. there's something really therapeutic about blinking ethernet lights...
2020-09-04 00:23:57	paulguy	like, specific licensed guitars by certain Japanese musicians, and it makes sense.

2020-09-04 00:24:14	beest	i nearly imported a japanese aerodyne from the uk before they started exporting them to the us again
2020-09-04 00:24:38	paulguy	i'm not looking in to guitar collecting, it's just neat seeing what's out there. :p
2020-09-04 00:24:50	paulguy	and i don't know enough to know like, good or bad tone or really differentiate them heh
2020-09-04 00:24:54	beest	once upon a time fender japan was serious business
2020-09-04 00:25:09	deltasquared	paulguy: lol no, I just find it comforting, like hdd hum
2020-09-04 00:26:13	beest	i don't miss the hum, but i do miss head noise
2020-09-04 00:26:39	deltasquared	beest: I can *hear* the end of that sentence, man
2020-09-04 00:26:55	deltasquared	that said, some hdds sounded better than others
2020-09-04 00:27:21	beest	yeah, there were some that were barely discernable from dot matrix printers
2020-09-04 00:27:42	beest	the late 80s-early 90s were a good time for hdd sonics
2020-09-04 00:27:43	 *	mpan wonders when his main HDD will die.
2020-09-04 00:27:50	deltasquared	I preferred the ones that sounded less like clicking and more like an orderly rattle
2020-09-04 00:27:56	+mpan	It’s above 68k hours now of nearly continuous work now.
2020-09-04 00:27:59	deltasquared	(when the heads moved)
2020-09-04 00:28:35	deltasquared	beest: right? they may have been loud but they had to be not unpleasant as a result
2020-09-04 00:28:51	beest	i think a lot of it also had to do with case design at the time
2020-09-04 00:29:03	beest	had a discernable effect on component acoustics
2020-09-04 00:29:14	paulguy	HDD hum can be not too bad
2020-09-04 00:29:16	deltasquared	then modern drives are like a whisper in comparison. I have to hold my ear next to them to even hear the heads move.
2020-09-04 00:29:25	paulguy	an HDD with a bearing that's going sounds awful
2020-09-04 00:29:39	deltasquared	speaking of bearings
2020-09-04 00:29:48	beest	my second hdd ever burst into flames
2020-09-04 00:29:49	deltasquared	if I intend to keep that old IDE drive around I had better power it up sometime

(can operate in USB mode and lend almost all it's functions - storage, microsd, mics, buttons, not the screen sadly)

2020-09-04 00:34:52	deltasquared	hdds plural even, I have three. one's a still-sealed USB unit, another is one that was a USB but I extracted the sata drive within, and the 3rd is this laptop's former hdd before I stuck a samsung 860 evo in it.

2020-09-04 00:36:03	deltasquared	I do try to look after them as the technology is somewhat being phased out but they still have valueable properties
2020-09-04 00:36:49	deltasquared	being easier to shred files on them for one. if it's multiple partitions I can just random-fill the partition in-place a few times without worrying about a pesky FTL hiding unwiped copies of erase blocks from me.
2020-09-04 00:37:03	paulguy	hard drives will probably be available fo at least anothe rdeacde.
2020-09-04 00:37:10	deltasquared	paulguy: in 2.5" form though?
2020-09-04 00:37:19	deltasquared	most of the big capacity drives are 3.5" now
2020-09-04 00:37:35	paulguy	ah yeah maybe not but a laptop is an awful place for a hard drive.  always has been :p
2020-09-04 00:38:21	deltasquared	2.5" ones are more useful for me due to their greater hotswap compatibility. I defy anyone to have a 3.5" hotswap bay in their laptop, bearing in mind some new ones don't even have an optical slot for a 2.5" one.
2020-09-04 00:38:37	deltasquared	which reminds me, what am I gonna fucking do when this laptop eventually dies
2020-09-04 00:39:06	deltasquared	a similar model my brother has which is older already showed a bios bug where it refuses to boot if the RTC goes beyond a certain date, so I might have that to look forward to
2020-09-04 00:39:37	deltasquared	so like all the new mainstream ones, no room for a hotswap bay, everything's soldered down most likely, replaceable batteries are rarer and rarer...
2020-09-04 00:40:10	deltasquared	I might have to do some pre-emptive shopping cause something tells me it might take a while to find one I'm happy with. >_>

2020-09-04 09:05:13	paulguy	chikkoroll, you have to do that yourself.  I think there's specifically either a freenode rule or at least a channel rule that providing public channel logs isn't allowed or something along those lines.

2020-09-04 11:48:23	SysGhost	talking of data caps. One thing I don't understand are those ISP's that have caps on land line/fiber
2020-09-04 11:48:30	dagle	chikkoroll: What?
2020-09-04 11:48:42	th0rne	Here unlimited was common before anyone had ever heard of 5G.
2020-09-04 11:49:00	dagle	th0rne: For under $30?
2020-09-04 11:49:04	th0rne	Yes?
2020-09-04 11:49:27	chikkoroll	did you mean that in the usa unlimited is becomming more common place-im not in us so not aware of status quo
2020-09-04 11:49:39	dagle	Because unlimited calls, texts and data is still expensive here. With 5G it's getting a lot cheaper.
2020-09-04 11:49:49	paulguy	i'd be totally fine with 5Mbit unlimited on mobile
2020-09-04 11:50:10	dagle	Atm it's cheaper for me to go over every month than buying unlimited.
2020-09-04 11:50:15	paulguy	sysghost in 2005 we got our first DSL and it was 1.5Mbit :p
2020-09-04 11:50:30	paulguy	which eventually downgraded to 768kbps because the infrastructure was breaking down.
2020-09-04 11:50:38	paulguy	and they enver fixed it
2020-09-04 11:50:42	th0rne	I don't remembered exactly, but I feel like you could get unlimited data for 20e five years ago, too.
2020-09-04 11:50:58	chikkoroll	same story playing out here

2020-09-04 11:51:54	paulguy	nbn got privatized didn't it?
2020-09-04 11:52:00	th0rne	And even before unlimited fast data, there was limited fast data and unlimited slow data.

2020-09-04 13:12:37	chikkoroll	hey guys i use google enough with a vpn to get very pissed off with the various captures used (must is google results) can i find or build a simple bot to avoid the captures after a search string is googled
2020-09-04 13:13:05	chikkoroll	steep learning curve or not for given task
2020-09-04 13:13:19	demize	Captures?
2020-09-04 13:13:35	chikkoroll	sorry captcha
2020-09-04 13:13:44	kaguya	ye, there's not much you can do
2020-09-04 13:13:55	kaguya	VPNs are often times used by bots
2020-09-04 13:14:19	kaguya	so the IPs used by VPN providers often times are flagged to be asked for captcha's more often
2020-09-04 13:14:36	chikkoroll	how so if it can be avoided by pple using bots to buy and resell shoes saw example of bot bypassing captcha 
2020-09-04 13:14:37	kaguya	only thing you can do is move to something self hosted
2020-09-04 13:15:02	kaguya	not sure how a bot would even bypass captcha's
2020-09-04 13:15:07	chikkoroll	nor me
2020-09-04 13:15:35	kaguya	my theory is they have humans to do the captchas and bots to do the rest or something
2020-09-04 13:15:37	chikkoroll	will keep digging interesting whatever the outcome
2020-09-04 13:16:36	chikkoroll	was a video could of been edited to just make it look like it could be done (hacking in most movies rofl) 
2020-09-04 13:17:15	chikkoroll	what is second to google 
2020-09-04 13:17:25	kaguya	like another search engine?
2020-09-04 13:18:08	chikkoroll	i know i can use duckduck n startpage etc but dont like the results-google is just too good
2020-09-04 13:18:13	chikkoroll	dam it 
2020-09-04 13:18:40	kaguya	Idk, Google is an echo chamber
2020-09-04 13:18:50	kaguya	also Startpage uses Google's crawlers
2020-09-04 13:18:53	chikkoroll	recommendations 
2020-09-04 13:19:00	kaguya	so it should be pretty good minus the echo chamber
2020-09-04 13:19:04	chikkoroll	id like to get out of the echo chamber im in
2020-09-04 13:19:09	chikkoroll	lol
2020-09-04 13:20:29	kaguya	DuckDuckGo may sometimes fail with non-English searches but overall it's pretty good

2020-09-04 14:38:42	Foxboron	"Anonymous way"?
2020-09-04 14:40:26	alwyn	some of us are concerned about doxing
2020-09-04 14:40:43	Foxboron	Why would that be a concern?
2020-09-04 14:42:21	alwyn	You mean if it should be a concern to begin with (aka unwarranted), or why they have those concerns?
2020-09-04 14:42:47	Foxboron	Yes why. And if you want trust you need some way to verify identity.
2020-09-04 14:43:00	alwyn	It's complicated
2020-09-04 14:43:13	Foxboron	Someone needs to have their name on the finances regardless. You can't write "Mr. Cat"
2020-09-04 14:43:31	alwyn	Hmm
2020-09-04 14:44:17	alwyn	Is there nothing like a .. shared (prepaid?) credit card where you can add funds through anonymous (enough) means?
2020-09-04 14:44:28	Foxboron	Who are fronting the prepaid credit card?
2020-09-04 14:44:34	BKC	What region are you in?
2020-09-04 14:44:39	Foxboron	and how do you trust the person fronting it?
2020-09-04 14:44:52	alwyn	But we had a short discussion about finances and gauged that isn't the biggest issue. Enough of us are okay with aiding there that the ones concerned about their anonimity don't need to contribute
2020-09-04 14:44:53	Foxboron	I'm inherently of the opinion that you can't establish trust between anonymous parties.

2020-09-04 14:45:21	Foxboron	How do you get the paper monies?
2020-09-04 14:45:26	BKC	ATM? :P
2020-09-04 14:45:28	Foxboron	It is going to be in someones name regardless
2020-09-04 14:45:34	novns	"anonymous parties" is nonsense.  one person can be anonymous
2020-09-04 14:45:51	Foxboron	BKC: and for that you need a bank account, which thus implies someone is having their name on the account
2020-09-04 14:45:54	alwyn	What is anonymous? I am not talking perfect anonymity but at least not knowing someone's personal name, address, etc.
2020-09-04 14:46:09	Foxboron	alwyn: that is pretty much the defining trait of being anonymous.
2020-09-04 14:46:13	alwyn	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2020-09-04 14:46:16	BKC	Foxboron: sure, but paper trails are waaay harder to follow than digital ones
2020-09-04 14:46:29	Foxboron	BKC: The digital one obviously matters
2020-09-04 14:46:36	alwyn	BKC: the majority of people in the community are from the US
2020-09-04 14:46:49	Foxboron	alwyn: The only thing I can think of is opencollective. But I don't think you can have everything anonymous
2020-09-04 14:46:54	BKC	alwyn: Then IDK
2020-09-04 14:46:54	Foxboron	Society doesn't work this way
2020-09-04 14:47:00	alwyn	Foxboron: it needs to be anonymous enough
2020-09-04 14:47:02	Foxboron	And I'm of the opinion that anonymity is dead...long live privacy
2020-09-04 14:47:12	Foxboron	alwyn: Then you just need to throw any financial stuff out the window
2020-09-04 14:47:23	BKC	Foxboron: Even for OC you still need to go through paypal, if the VPS provider has that option...
2020-09-04 14:47:47	alwyn	opencollective looks good
2020-09-04 14:47:51	Foxboron	BKC: Someone is suggesting crypto currencies within the next 5 lines
2020-09-04 14:47:54	alwyn	That's fine
2020-09-04 14:47:58	BKC	Foxboron: LOL :D
2020-09-04 14:47:59	alwyn	It's better than just straight out
2020-09-04 14:48:03	novns	alwyn, if you want do do a good job anonymously, just do it for free, at your own expenses
2020-09-04 14:48:06	Foxboron	alwyn: I have no faith in you being able to use that anonymous.

2020-09-04 14:49:06	alwyn	And go to the administrative aspect
2020-09-04 14:49:14	novns	alwyn, and if you want to sale illegal drugs or child pornography, just stop

2020-09-04 14:50:05	novns	Foxboron, I would not please you by fucking off
2020-09-04 14:50:22	Foxboron	I assure you nobody wants that
2020-09-04 14:50:33	kaguya	novns: then at least do the right thing and keep fucked up shit out of this
2020-09-04 14:51:08	alwyn	So
2020-09-04 14:51:26	alwyn	Distributed control, there's several layers there
2020-09-04 14:51:31	novns	alwyn, if you use some "anonymous VPS", you are no longer anonymous
2020-09-04 14:51:35	BKC	alwyn: for the DNS, there are anon services (mostly used for shady business). The VPS could be registered to an Org though (w/ some generic contact info)
2020-09-04 14:51:50	alwyn	Okay, I'm sorry :(
2020-09-04 14:52:17	BKC	Though doxing someone by their VPS provider is not exaclty common...
2020-09-04 14:52:36	alwyn	Anonimity is a desire, not an absolute requirement, at least for the hosting aspect. For the using aspect not-logging IP addresses is desirable.
2020-09-04 14:52:52	alwyn	So, distributed administrative power/control
2020-09-04 14:53:07	novns	BKC, all those "anonymous" providers sell their data in "dark web"
2020-09-04 14:53:13	BKC	novns: "all"
2020-09-04 14:53:20	BKC	Most yes, but there are good ones
2020-09-04 14:53:21	novns	99% of them
2020-09-04 14:53:30	alwyn	I know DigitalOcean has a Teams feature, but I have no experience with them. Anyone with experience know if that would be sufficient?
2020-09-04 14:53:58	BKC	novns: Njalla is nice

2020-09-04 16:20:42	kaguya	8GB is barely enough in 2020
2020-09-04 16:20:52	deltasquared	hm, I'd want moar ram to go with that many cores. (it has SMT I presume as well?)

2020-09-04 16:24:49	deltasquared	as an experiment on my previous job's work laptop (I think it was an 8th gen i7 U variant), I made it run at 400mhz.
2020-09-04 16:24:59	deltasquared	(after bootup mind)
2020-09-04 16:25:10	deltasquared	given the thing was running windows, it was surprisingly responsive.
2020-09-04 16:25:37	deltasquared	all that push on the async stuff in the windows runtime and so on must have payed off.
2020-09-04 16:26:09	deltasquared	ironically the only thing that sometimes acted up was the lock screen.
2020-09-04 16:26:36	deltasquared	so apparently the many slower but power efficient cores idea has some degree of merit.

2020-09-04 17:11:56	HEX0	also keep in mind that certain phones are fucked with custom roms. I guess they're too much pain to maintain. I guess oneplus gets best support in terms of stability etc
2020-09-04 17:12:05	kaguya	HEX0: I looked around on the XDA forums and found a few ROMs for my A10 model but none flagged as stable or even rc
2020-09-04 17:12:32	HEX0	kinda like nexus did back in the day
2020-09-04 17:12:35	zaszi	randomly downloading roms from a forum that are also not signed or checksummed is usually a bad idea, anyways :P
2020-09-04 17:12:57	kaguya	the ROMs were afaik checksummed but they were very much early beta builds
2020-09-04 17:13:10	kaguya	couldn't even do LTE or use the camera
2020-09-04 17:13:34	kaguya	and this phone is also an Exynos
2020-09-04 17:13:54	kaguya	so even tho technically SGIs are supported I highly doubt any would actually work on it

2020-09-07 11:16:48	grawity	*that* should be possible because afaik BT HID just carries the same info as USB HID anyway
2020-09-07 11:17:21	grawity	but emulating a gameport should be possible too, with some work (I mean if you already have the bluetooth part solved).... how do programs access gameports – through some I/O port?
2020-09-07 11:18:08	first-order	I would assume through the gameport on older sound cards.

2020-09-08 11:20:13	paulguy	even my relatively simple program will have like 4 layers of abstraction.

2020-09-08 11:20:39	paulguy	crustyvm write callback -> gfx_whatever -> tilemap_whatever -> SDL_Whatever
2020-09-08 11:21:27	paulguy	since tilemap.h/.c is kinda separate from crustyvm, so there's a function to unpack the callback and translate it.
2020-09-08 11:21:49	paulguy	it's something one could theoretically just write directly to in C if they wanted.
2020-09-08 11:22:02	paulguy	it still depends on SDL though
2020-09-08 11:28:49	paulguy	kinda want to do the audio system similarly.  just very generic, just depending on SDL.
2020-09-08 11:29:31	paulguy	although it'll have to have its own way to signal back to the caller that there needs to be more audio rendered, but that will just be entirely controlled by a script.

2020-09-09 13:09:06	xulfer	heh love trying to help people that already know everything about 'computers'
2020-09-09 13:09:42	xulfer	guy is like... well i replaced all the thermal paste, and all the fans... but it still acts sporadic 
2020-09-09 13:09:49	xulfer	i'm like... have you considered memory?
2020-09-09 13:10:02	xulfer	'i have enough memory' :/
2020-09-09 13:10:11	opt1mus	yes, same sort of people that are cab drivers full time, "oh you code, I learnt to code once, HTML."
2020-09-09 13:10:22	opt1mus	yes, yes indeed
2020-09-09 13:11:04	xulfer	because if you're the type that checks thermal paste first you might have just fucked it up more
2020-09-09 13:11:14	xulfer	i doubt that person handles cpus... well
2020-09-09 13:11:39	xulfer	but he was like... 'are you a repair tech?'  'no...' so that was the end of it heh
2020-09-09 13:11:51	pantsu	if you put thermal paste on fans you also have a problem
2020-09-09 13:12:01	xulfer	i was just like please just run memtest86 and if it passes then just ignore me
2020-09-09 13:12:03	opt1mus	yeah, my computer is slow to boot, so I am just checking the resistance on all the CPU pins

2020-09-09 13:21:55	opt1mus	that thing was cursed, the initial "oh hey, you know 'computers' right?", was that the computer was slow, I booted it on another rig and it was riddled with malware, this guy had been downloading multiple malware programs, clearly in some desperate attempt to fix some perceived initial problem, my guess they googled something with the words 'help virus fix' or whatever, and installed

2020-09-09 13:24:32	andrewSC	it works well enough for me.. i wasn't sure if you were also referring to the self-managed/self-hosted server portion or just the client
2020-09-09 13:25:45	xulfer	opt1mus: ha which is sad.  i mean i feel bad for those people, but i mean... if you're in that deep you need to hire someone
2020-09-09 13:26:03	andrewSC	only thing that i've noticed that is slightly obtuse is if you add/update a password on one machine/browser then go to use the new cred. on a different machine/browser. idk what the time interval is for the sync but i've found i have to manually sync between the different clients to get the latest
2020-09-09 13:26:17	andrewSC	like two? three button clicks but i'll survive lol
2020-09-09 13:26:54	xulfer	andrewSC: yeah that stuff is a pain.  i just do it by hand myself (via keepass)

2020-09-09 14:05:30	deltasquared	hmmm... not many >1gbit usb3 ethernet adapters around (most of them requiring out-of-tree linux kernel modules) and no networking crossover cables either... what to do if one wants >gigabit transfers but can't fit a pcie adapter (e.g. laptops). hrm
2020-09-09 14:07:00	deltasquared	(for the latter I guess it's not too much different from taking two usb eth adapters and just using a really short patch cable, heh)

2020-09-09 14:53:39	deltasquared	desu: I'm having trouble finding direct specs myself, but the specs page for the laptop itself describes it as follows:

2020-09-09 14:53:56	desu	found random russian datasheet, looks like TN but doesn't explicitly say
2020-09-09 14:53:58	andrewSC	yeah i'm only familiar with ldap and ldaps lol
2020-09-09 14:54:12	deltasquared	desu: does that bit I found from the manufacturer give any hints?
2020-09-09 14:54:30	deltasquared	tft active matrix isn't awfully descriptive thinking about it, that's quite a wide class of tech surely
2020-09-09 14:55:21	deltasquared	doesn't directly relate to either twisted nematic or in-plane switching
2020-09-09 14:55:33	jelle	SCHAPiE: yup
2020-09-09 14:55:38	desu	full model name is apparently LTN* and specs values indicates TN

2020-09-09 14:55:48	jelle	:D
2020-09-09 14:56:46	desu	contrast ration of 500 and typical 45 degree viewing angle
2020-09-09 14:56:48	andrewSC	hahah
2020-09-09 14:56:49	desu	yea....
2020-09-09 14:57:24	deltasquared	desu: I'm not really all that bothered by viewing angle, especially given that on a laptop I am used to adjusted the hinge to make the screen parallel to my line of sight anyway.
2020-09-09 14:57:42	desu	well, 45*2 probably
2020-09-09 14:57:44	deltasquared	and I personally find the effect it gives in the right circumstances to be quite pretty
2020-09-09 14:57:47	jelle	SCHAPiE: first lunc
2020-09-09 14:58:06	deltasquared	horizontal view angle isn't a problem either; I can just turn the entire laptop to face me again
2020-09-09 14:58:26	deltasquared	even if the colours didn't look washed out at the side, I find it awkward to look at a display when it's angled slightly away from me.
2020-09-09 14:59:01	deltasquared	desu: alas I don't think I have a good enough camera to pick up that "gradient effect" I described

2020-09-09 15:03:59	deltasquared	the camera sees more of a sunset effect weirdly. more green/orange towards the bottom
2020-09-09 15:04:20	deltasquared	I have no explaination for that lel

2020-09-10 18:16:36	MrElendig	preferably gen11 when they come out
2020-09-10 18:16:39	LambdaComplex	i use an apu4b4 as my router/gateway
2020-09-10 18:16:44	MrElendig	(will have av1 in hardware)
2020-09-10 18:16:44	LambdaComplex	no complaints here

2020-09-10 18:17:11	novns	pulec, that knowledge would be useful
2020-09-10 18:17:21	MrElendig	th0rne: downside is of course price, 500 vs 100€
2020-09-10 18:17:26	th0rne	Right.
2020-09-10 18:17:32	th0rne	That's a big difference.
2020-09-10 18:17:48	MrElendig	but it makes a massive difference in useability

2020-09-10 18:17:55	MrElendig	and you can of course multipuropse the box

2020-09-14 15:36:50	deltasquared	might keep an eye on the 2x16 kits though. I did originally have a 4x8 kit in my old desktop tower build, but that became my dad's WFH rig as I'd downsized anyway. so that itx is stuck on "only" 2x4GB that I had spare for now.
2020-09-14 15:37:07	MrElendig	only 600€ for 4
2020-09-14 15:37:40	MrElendig	not that terrible for 3600c18

2020-09-14 15:39:46	MrElendig	a lot of the 2667 sticks will do 3200 without losing up the subtimings too much
2020-09-14 15:40:16	MrElendig	will have to bump the voltage way up from the standard 1.2 of course
2020-09-14 15:40:17	deltasquared	MrElendig: I've actually had trouble hitting 3200 even on modules rated for it (and on the provided XMP set even) on this build. might be that earlier ryzen's pickyness about memory idk.

2020-09-14 15:55:43	Shapeshifter	Thing is, we have a super-awesome online tool for solving exercises, with autocorrection via unit tests that we write, since there are hundreds of students. But they also shouldn't think that python=our online tool...

2020-09-14 16:10:45	KaMii	sounds like your uni is a prison

2020-09-14 16:20:13	KaMii	when you just lump everything into one and ignore demographics, then you are not doing science or medicine you are pushing policy based on emotion

2020-09-14 16:29:56	opt1mus	we went to Bikini Black at our sites
2020-09-14 16:30:07	kevr	point being, yeah for a while airport travel changed, some things changed, but it went away for the most part. what you go through now at airports is the same thing as you went through before 9/11, it's just a little more paranoid now
2020-09-14 16:30:11	KaMii	and the US isnt going OMG EVERONE IS DYING!?!?!?
2020-09-14 16:30:14	kevr	but it's still the same criteria

2020-09-14 16:39:38	KaMii	there were nothing different going on in the way the two towns operated in the covid response
2020-09-14 16:39:48	KaMii	so just comparing major numbers without context is pointless
2020-09-14 16:40:04	KaMii	thats the problem, everyone wants to talk about large numbers but no one wants to look at context
2020-09-14 16:40:04	novns	opt1mus, in some cases "being on the side of caution" means escalating conflicts and doing damage
2020-09-14 16:40:18	KaMii	because you are all mindlessly doing and following what your televisiont ells you
2020-09-14 16:40:30	KaMii	novns: exactly
2020-09-14 16:40:36	kevr	you're assuming a lot
2020-09-14 16:40:40	KaMii	which is why this, "common sense" crap is nonsense
2020-09-14 16:40:43	kevr	i said "looking at differences between areas"
2020-09-14 16:40:54	kevr	i didn't say "looking at one variable of the equation"
2020-09-14 16:41:07	KaMii	yes and you cannot look at the differencens until you have context of the situation
2020-09-14 16:41:23	KaMii	no you need to isolate variables, not look at one
2020-09-14 16:41:40	KaMii	isolate them meaning, take the ones out of the equasion that have no significance to the context
2020-09-14 16:42:11	MrElendig	if it wasn't for the saunas, finland would have been immune to covid
2020-09-14 16:42:20	KaMii	no

2020-09-14 16:44:29	KaMii	this is the problem,
2020-09-14 16:44:34	kevr	let's just say that the numbers about what kinda reductions in infection rates from areas on the media is all i'm claiming
2020-09-14 16:44:40	kevr	prove them wrong
2020-09-14 16:45:02	KaMii	i didnt undestand that statement
2020-09-14 16:45:26	kevr	the media has constantly given out rates of infection all across the country, and that rate changes in different counties that have different rules about guidelines
2020-09-14 16:45:27	novns	kevr, nobody counts infections properly
2020-09-14 16:45:33	kevr	prove them wrong.
2020-09-14 16:45:36	novns	kevr, nobody counts infections properly
2020-09-14 16:45:43	MrElendig	KaMii: the difference in responce norway and sweeden took, and the statistics that followed
2020-09-14 16:45:44	novns	there is no real statistics
2020-09-14 16:45:47	kevr	because, they've shown that places following the guidelines do reduce the infection rate.
2020-09-14 16:45:49	KaMii	and im not too concerned with infection rates, im more concerned with deaths, and thats what i have looked at and the demographics surrounding mortality are quite clear
2020-09-14 16:46:10	kevr	it's decreased deaths too
2020-09-14 16:46:16	novns	all media have is some narrative, optionally payed by some corporations
2020-09-14 16:46:29	kevr	go look at the differences in hospital bed/death rates at times when it was locked down vs times when it wasn't locked down
2020-09-14 16:46:35	kevr	and in which businesses
2020-09-14 16:46:38	kevr	it's clear that it helps
2020-09-14 16:46:43	novns	and all facts that don't support the narrative are silenced
2020-09-14 16:46:55	KaMii	too bad medicine doesnt work that way during a pandemi
2020-09-14 16:47:07	kevr	lmao
2020-09-14 16:47:16	KaMii	we need to also know what was going on in what times, how was the pandemic treding at the time?
2020-09-14 16:47:17	MrElendig	KaMii: for the stores here in norway, the "goverment control" not only helped against corona, it cut the overall sick leave in half
2020-09-14 16:47:19	KaMii	were we at the peak?
2020-09-14 16:47:32	KaMii	these things are important, you cant just ignore variables and context
2020-09-14 16:47:36	kevr	not really
2020-09-14 16:47:37	MrElendig	turns out it worked well against the common cold etc too
2020-09-14 16:47:38	kevr	go look at relative rates
2020-09-14 16:47:44	KaMii	but when you want to lump everything into one large number you dont get to the truth
2020-09-14 16:47:46	novns	KaMii, there is no peak, it will last about 10 years at least
2020-09-14 16:47:59	KaMii	MrElendig: theres like 3 million people in norway
2020-09-14 16:48:06	kevr	so, like i say
2020-09-14 16:48:07	KaMii	not really a good place to making comparisons
2020-09-14 16:48:08	kevr	prove them wrong
2020-09-14 16:48:23	MrElendig	one of the food chains did the math and they ended up saving money despite the extra work and cost to modify the stores
2020-09-14 16:48:28	MrElendig	kevr: you are off by almost 100%
2020-09-14 16:48:32	MrElendig	er.. KaMii

2020-09-15 22:27:15	+mpan	deltasquared: how many consumers are willing to pay for a customized connector (not off-the-shelf in a supply chain) or a separate board with mounting in the bay?
2020-09-15 22:27:19	+mpan	Here you have the answer.
2020-09-15 22:27:24	paulguy	i think i remember some old SCSI hot swap bays that probably have something like that.  laptop hotswap bays frequently had something like that, so i imagine there's something for desktops.
2020-09-15 22:27:29	paulguy	something modern
2020-09-15 22:28:03	paulguy	but there might've been some standards for hot swap SCSI connectors.
2020-09-15 22:28:16	deltasquared	mpan: well I wouldn't mind accepting the market pattern in this regard, except for the fact that UAS sata bridges are universally trash.
2020-09-15 22:28:26	paulguy	or at least, a SCSI connection that was intended to withstand reconnection between than it's pin connectors
2020-09-15 22:28:35	+mpan	I have old PATA drawer that has a separate board, which — theoretically — you an replace. But it must be like 1990s.
2020-09-15 22:28:37	deltasquared	so for actually decent external storage I'm forced to hotswap sata drives, hence my durability concerns

2020-09-15 22:29:16	paulguy	eSATA was a consideration for external/powered hotplug SATA.
2020-09-15 22:29:18	+mpan	And yes, I understand your concerns well. Not even because of wear, but it’s enough that there is some misalignment.
2020-09-15 22:29:36	paulguy	nowadays it's pretty much just replaced with USB
2020-09-15 22:29:44	paulguy	because USB is faster now
2020-09-15 22:29:50	+mpan	I am just trying to explain why this is not the case.
2020-09-15 22:30:11	paulguy	i guess something kinda similar is CFast
2020-09-15 22:30:18	+mpan	Well, why it MIGHT not be the case. As in this case I have no actual data.
2020-09-15 22:30:23	paulguy	where they stick an SSD in a somewhat large format memory card
2020-09-15 22:30:31	paulguy	which is intended for hotswapping
2020-09-15 22:30:55	paulguy	but i don't know if there's anything particularly standard in the 3.5" formfactor
2020-09-15 22:31:44	deltasquared	I have seen some 2.5" -> 3.5" adapters that do protectively nest the connectors. so there at least on the desktop I could use a chonkier hotswap bay, and the hotswap bay itself will presumably have been built to at least outlast N * drive lifetime wear cycles, where N is likely greater than 1 for a lot of use cases.
2020-09-15 22:31:56	deltasquared	that solution is alas not so great for my laptop >_>
2020-09-15 22:32:42	paulguy	handling hard drives in general is already fairly iffy heh
2020-09-15 22:33:39	paulguy	a neat thing macs could do (maybe still can) if you want to share data from a macbook to another PC is they could be put in target disk mode, where they appear as a firewire device which is just the internal disk
2020-09-15 22:33:43	+mpan	BTW: that HDD drawer I have from 1990s, is actually using SCSI connector for mating.
2020-09-15 22:33:48	deltasquared	another solution might be to buy m.2 sata storage and use 2.5" adapters for that. but due to the lack of presence of 3.3v lines in most sata power implementations (de facto omission it seems), there's always the need for some power conversion to 3.3v for m.2 sata devices.
2020-09-15 22:34:10	deltasquared	and such power conversion is either crap (linear regulators for 1.5+A? no thanks) or expensive.
2020-09-15 22:34:22	paulguy	eh linear regulators are fine. :p
2020-09-15 22:34:26	+mpan	So it’s PATA, wired to SCSI socket in the bay, SCSI plug on the HDD case, wired to PATA.
2020-09-15 22:34:35	paulguy	they're less crap than a cheap switching regulator

2020-09-15 22:39:38	paulguy	then just use UMS

2020-09-15 22:42:10	deltasquared	one option I haven't pursued yet is a USB nvme bridge.
2020-09-15 22:42:16	paulguy	are there any native USB hard disks?

2020-09-15 22:42:48	+mpan	But if you do not need high transfer speeds, why bother with trying to achieve them? Except perfectionism, which I fully resonate with, but sometimes it’s reasonable to ignore perfectionism.
2020-09-15 22:43:32	deltasquared	well for a laptop use case a USB dongle dangle (heh) is cumbersome and inelegant.
2020-09-15 22:44:08	deltasquared	the "m.2 in sata skin" idea is the most viable so far as it can exist inside the laptop's volume. (as can my current setup, sans connector durability)

2020-09-16 00:21:07	SysGhost	It's hip to slap an "e" infront of pretty much everything. Just like it was slapping an "i" a bunch of years ago.

2020-09-16 00:23:00	paulguy	but yeah they probably are more intended for older folks or maybe people who use their bike for work or something.
2020-09-16 00:23:09	paulguy	like for deliveries or something
2020-09-16 00:23:34	SysGhost	it's increasing a lot here in Europe. Was popular before, and getting even more so now.
2020-09-16 00:23:45	SysGhost	eScooters too.
2020-09-16 00:24:15	paulguy	probably an efficient way to commute a bit easier while not having a car.
2020-09-16 00:24:23	paulguy	well, versus using a car
2020-09-16 00:24:43	SysGhost	and a whole lot cheaper too. For less than €50 / year in energy cost.
2020-09-16 00:25:06	SysGhost	...if traveling 10-20 km every day.
2020-09-16 00:25:45	SysGhost	and no need to pay for expensive parking either.

2020-09-17 15:18:37	chee	an unexpected knock on my door has brought a pinephone
2020-09-17 15:18:51	chee	maybe i should install arch linux on it
2020-09-17 15:19:26	pulec	deltasquared: APROOVED
2020-09-17 15:19:33	chee	it's currently running postmarketos w/ phosh
2020-09-17 15:19:49	pulec	oh yeee pinephone
2020-09-17 15:19:57	pulec	I had it for a day before I lost it drunk
2020-09-17 15:20:01	chee	pulec: oh dang
2020-09-17 15:20:16	pulec	I recall there is a 'hw check' on startup
2020-09-17 15:20:34	pulec	apparently it comes with a postmarket now, neat
2020-09-17 15:20:48	pulec	I saw someone running Super mario 64 on it
2020-09-17 15:21:09	deltasquared	server's up folks
2020-09-17 15:21:20	deltasquared	I've added the users I recall being most active to the whitelist
2020-09-17 15:21:46	deltasquared	based on looking at the auth file
2020-09-17 15:22:05	deltasquared	pulec: I assume the worldedit user was you, I don't recall doing such a thing
2020-09-17 15:22:25	chee	pulec: yes there's a "pinephone community edition" that comes with postmarketos
2020-09-17 15:22:31	chee	that's the one i have
2020-09-17 15:22:48	chee	there's forthcoming void linux support on the way, but maybe i should install arch for now
2020-09-17 15:23:30	jelle	chee: congrats
2020-09-17 15:23:37	jelle	chee: the emacs phone is here
2020-09-17 15:24:07	pulec	worldedit?

2020-09-17 15:25:06	opt1mus	you'll need three hands with 6 fingers on each to operate it
2020-09-17 15:25:39	chee	i guess i could map vol-up to meta and vol-down to ctrl
2020-09-17 15:25:41	pulec	on a tiny phone? gl
2020-09-17 15:26:54	deltasquared	pulec: there is a user called worldedit in the auth file (think of it as /etc/passwd for the world). if you don't recall doing such a thing then it is likely someone trying to be clever, so I'll leave it out of the whitelist.
2020-09-17 15:27:18	pulec	ok, first attack!

2020-09-22 16:09:01	jelle	oo
2020-09-22 16:09:14	jelle	seems lxd only needs a rootfs
2020-09-22 16:09:24	pulec	can systemd containers (nspawn) be used for same stuff lxd container would be used?
2020-09-22 16:09:32	jelle	sure I guess
2020-09-22 16:09:32	pulec	where does docker fit in?
2020-09-22 16:09:43	Foxboron	OCI containers are just a tarball with a JSON config and a rootfs
2020-09-22 16:09:45	jelle	docker is just a "runtime" and registry
2020-09-22 16:09:57	Foxboron	you can unpack a docker container and use nspawn on it
2020-09-22 16:10:09	jelle	Foxboron: I guess the same for lxd then
2020-09-22 16:10:13	Foxboron	probably :D

2020-09-22 18:47:25	xulfer	Damn
2020-09-22 18:47:27	deltasquared	so I'm currently without one and still getting some symptoms, although reduced now
2020-09-22 18:47:33	xulfer	Why would a GP dispute that?
2020-09-22 18:47:47	deltasquared	xulfer: apparently nothing in the specialist's letter quoted six weeks.
2020-09-22 18:47:50	deltasquared	(to the GP)
2020-09-22 18:47:54	xulfer	ah
2020-09-22 18:48:02	xulfer	so he's not just being an ass, there's a mixup of sorts?

2020-09-22 18:49:06	xulfer	ah okay... yeah if my GP disputed something like that on me i'd be pissed, but my GP and i are pretty cool 
2020-09-22 18:49:51	deltasquared	so I can only assume the GP gave me the 3-week note on account of recovery, not adjustment to the medication (their exact sentence on that was "we do not normally issue sick notes for nortriptyline")
2020-09-22 18:51:28	deltasquared	xulfer: thing is without an appt which may be a month away I have to essentially wait until the specialist has time free at the end of their shift for them to call me, usually around 5pm. and they're not actually in the practice where I saw them every day of the week, they're visiting on those days or something.
2020-09-22 18:52:02	deltasquared	he tried to call me friday and it was in the exact five minutes I helped with something for dinner briefly >_>
2020-09-22 18:52:04	xulfer	ahh

2020-09-22 18:54:12	xulfer	deltasquared: that's why i go to a uni hospital for all of my doctors visits.  At least around here specialists and such are almost always mainly based at teaching hospitals
2020-09-22 18:54:29	jelle	CURRY
2020-09-22 18:55:33	deltasquared	xulfer: well thing is in theory in the NHS if one wants to move GP, you have to technically first de-assign from the existing practice location, then in theory the target one could become full or whatever at any time and then you're in limbo unable to seek GP help at all.
2020-09-22 18:55:38	opt1mus	chef in our canteen has been making quite a lot of spicy dishes lately, which I don't mind at all, but I think others are getting burned out
2020-09-22 18:55:56	xulfer	really?  that's weird

2020-09-22 18:57:20	deltasquared	well if I didn't find a GP and it was urgent I guess I'd just go to the hospital. it's not like they can refuse if there is a genuine reason the GP can't handle it at all. it's sort of an entitlement almost here. we do pay tax for it after all...
2020-09-22 18:57:57	deltasquared	mnrmnaugh: heh, if the headaches were bad enough just for reasons of apparently overreaction, I'd ask if I could have the nerves in question permanently served. :P

2020-09-22 19:11:26	paulguy	at least in the UK you're probably not so required to drive to get places.
2020-09-22 19:11:28	xulfer	i mean that's the crux of it... i mean someone having a full on siezure probably couldn't
2020-09-22 19:11:59	deltasquared	xulfer: I didn't think there was much point bothering if I couldn't get somewhere reasonably fast. traffic notwithstanding of course.

2020-09-22 19:17:44	paulguy	it probably wouldn't satisfy the stimulation necessary for one on meth

2020-09-22 19:35:24	deltasquared	it just boils down to automatic cross-system file syncing without having to worry about e.g. file X on machine A gets edited, I forget to sync that with machine B and end up having to edit file X again but in a different manner, then when I get home the copy of X from machine B silently winning.
2020-09-22 19:36:05	deltasquared	I'd instead need that situation to be detected and the computer yell at me
2020-09-22 19:36:11	deltasquared	to check the files and fix manually
2020-09-22 19:37:11	deltasquared	git can check this because different edits changes the hashes and then it'd want to merge the disjoint histories, which would fail on a (non-force) push because it's not a fastforward.

2020-09-22 19:49:42	paulguy	i dunno probably 1080p
2020-09-22 19:50:10	deltasquared	paulguy: idk it's buffering ahead fine here
2020-09-22 19:50:28	paulguy	which 194MB for a like 15 minute video at 1080p is pretty impressive even if it's youtube crust quality
2020-09-22 19:50:44	deltasquared	inb4 CDN and page JS having a disagreement in your particular case idk
2020-09-22 19:51:12	paulguy	194MB for 15 minutes at 1080p almost seems erroneous..
2020-09-22 19:51:21	paulguy	it shouldn't be _that_ small
2020-09-22 19:51:50	deltasquared	YTDL's formats output is some CDN indicated estimate IIRC
2020-09-22 19:52:10	paulguy	yeah i guess we'll see how big it ends up being
2020-09-22 19:52:26	deltasquared	if you get that from actual download, well the footage involves a lot of static bits so maybe the compression gets a free lunch.

2020-09-22 19:56:52	paulguy	running it directly in to a media player seems to have worse results when the connection is poor.
2020-09-22 19:57:03	paulguy	and a media player won't necessarily download the whole stream
2020-09-22 19:57:23	deltasquared	true I have had problemss with the mpv ytdl hook before on some videos. had to manually download them in /tmp first.
2020-09-22 19:58:11	paulguy	looks like by the time it's downloaded it'll have taken almost exactly the amount of time necessary to have played it realtime.
2020-09-22 19:58:43	deltasquared	sometimes if I do encounter a problematic video, I will ytdl one of the combined formats if available then tell mpv to start playing the partial file.
2020-09-22 19:58:52	deltasquared	though for YT itself that limits one to 720p

2020-09-22 20:09:53	deltasquared	e.g. minimising copies.
2020-09-22 20:09:53	paulguy	so it's probably just doing the full conversion on CPU

2020-09-22 20:12:56	paulguy	would submitting the individual writes directly to video memory be faster than doing it all in system memory then doing a large transfer?
2020-09-22 20:13:15	deltasquared	depends on the caching coherence I'd wager
2020-09-22 20:13:44	deltasquared	if you were careful and were nice to the OS, you probably could mark it cached but coherent and let the cpu do what cpus generall do, and evict cache lines in the background.
2020-09-22 20:14:13	deltasquared	this would work especially well on integrated gpus that are unified memory access (e.g. they address the same memory space because they borrow a bit)
2020-09-22 20:14:18	paulguy	it would be primarily read-only then write-only over pci express
2020-09-22 20:14:29	paulguy	and the driver might do some kind of write combining
2020-09-22 20:15:37	--	opt1mus is now known as opt^mus
2020-09-22 20:15:41	paulguy	on the other hand, pushing a whole texture might be able to rely on some like super fast DMA that the CPU doesn't even need to care what's going on.

2020-09-22 20:17:11	deltasquared	paulguy: still need to allocate the "DMA window" at least. then you'd point your fancy SSE optimised palette decoder there heh
2020-09-22 20:17:19	deltasquared	also there is again texture swizzling to worry about
2020-09-22 20:17:28	paulguy	yeah
2020-09-22 20:17:28	deltasquared	and whether the driver does that which would slow things down a lot
2020-09-22 20:17:33	paulguy	wonder where that ends up happening
2020-09-22 20:18:01	paulguy	i forget how slow my swizzler was
2020-09-22 20:18:05	deltasquared	IIRC some gpus *can* handle unswizzled albeit with a performance hit to sample
2020-09-22 20:18:17	deltasquared	there's some sort of image format hint one can check and set
2020-09-22 20:18:23	deltasquared	in opengl at least
2020-09-22 20:18:43	deltasquared	likely openGLES again omits this because they reckoned nobody there would bother. >_>
2020-09-22 20:19:14	paulguy	thankfully a lot of modern mobile devices can do vulkan
2020-09-22 20:19:46	deltasquared	I swear some of the stuff "missing" before GLES3.0 is just like why would you even omit that reeeeee
2020-09-22 20:20:01	deltasquared	I can't think of any specific examples rn
2020-09-22 20:20:12	paulguy	i guess consider what mobile gaming was when opengl es 1.x and 2.x came out :p
2020-09-22 20:20:26	deltasquared	barely moving on from java midlets?
2020-09-22 20:20:35	deltasquared	or was the term applets
2020-09-22 20:20:39	deltasquared	J2ME
2020-09-22 20:20:42	paulguy	applets i think
2020-09-22 20:21:06	paulguy	and whole UI acceleration?  video playback acceleration with opengl on a phone?  no way :D
2020-09-22 20:22:06	deltasquared	I came across an interesting app on f-droid btw. forget the name but it recompiles J2ME into dalvik bytecode and loads it natively, substituting standard library class implementations as it goes. (wonder how well that works with ahead of time compilation)
2020-09-22 20:22:17	deltasquared	there is IIRC an interpreted mode option.
2020-09-22 20:22:22	paulguy	i think the iphone is the first to have either of those and it wasn't out when opengl es 2.0 came out heh
2020-09-22 20:22:39	paulguy	deltasquared, nifty.
2020-09-22 20:23:00	paulguy	i know there're such J2ME emulators for PCs but they tend to be pretty bad heh
2020-09-22 20:23:28	deltasquared	nah this was one example of java and JVM's supposed write-once-run-anywhere slogan actually really shining
2020-09-22 20:23:53	deltasquared	almost makes me wonder if some games would run too fast
2020-09-22 20:24:15	deltasquared	it'd probably hit the 60fps vsync limit assuming that was on but still
2020-09-22 20:24:56	paulguy	heh you might be right.  I could see even back then there being issues with apps developed on a veyr low end device where timing wasn't considered by the developer, running too fast on higher end phones.
2020-09-22 20:26:03	deltasquared	there's a good archive of j2me applet games on the internet archive IIRC. all old stuff naturally
2020-09-22 20:26:38	deltasquared	also the f-droid thing was https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ru.playsoftware.j2meloader/
2020-09-22 20:26:40	@phrik	Title: J2ME Loader | F-Droid - Free and Open Source Android App Repository (at f-droid.org)
2020-09-22 20:26:43	paulguy	i've seen some streams of j2me games :p
2020-09-22 20:27:00	paulguy	i think there was even a version of morrowind or something
2020-09-22 20:27:11	paulguy	or some elder scrolls game
2020-09-22 20:27:35	paulguy	obviously a very much "handheld port" in that it wasn't 3D nor played anything like the original :p
2020-09-22 20:27:48	deltasquared	paulguy: also let's not forget the most important feature, glorious integer upscaling
2020-09-22 20:28:01	deltasquared	seeing as most applets were designed for like 128x128 nokias
2020-09-22 20:28:23	paulguy	yeah hehe
2020-09-22 20:28:43	deltasquared	which on my device often worked out to an 8x upscale
2020-09-22 20:28:49	paulguy	these games really were just a step up from calculator games or like commodore 64 BASIC games.
2020-09-22 20:28:53	deltasquared	depending on the soft keys needed
2020-09-22 20:29:25	paulguy	the hardware of the day was so miserably underpowered and overpriced. :p
2020-09-22 20:30:12	paulguy	you could get more computational power out of like a $60 v-tech educational computer
2020-09-22 20:30:35	paulguy	or even just something like a nintendo DS
2020-09-22 20:30:39	deltasquared	I do wonder if j2me allowed for dynamic textures to be panned about. now I want to see someone do a tiny 1pixel per block terraria or such heh
2020-09-22 20:31:09	paulguy	i'm not sure if _any_ phones before the iphone even had any 3D hardware to speak of and it was just all done in software.
2020-09-22 20:31:16	mnrmnaugh	!later tell dp https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24551808

2020-09-22 20:31:33	deltasquared	at least 2d blitting is vastly easier than attempting anything 3d.
2020-09-22 20:31:44	paulguy	and you'd be spending $400+ for that shit
2020-09-22 20:31:44	mnrmnaugh	>It was so bad that if I increased voltage load in my home past a certain point then the streetlights in the front of my home would completely turn off.. Yes I could turn city infrastructure off and on by toggling the voltage load in my home.

2020-09-22 20:32:13	deltasquared	paulguy: and at the screen resolutions involved the n^2 problem with screen density wouldn'tt have yet come around to kick any cpu blitting in the teeth overly hard.

2020-09-22 20:45:53	+mpan	Yes, but this guy has shown that even on a single core you can experience the very same phenomena.
2020-09-22 20:46:48	deltasquared	I forget the exact quote but "oh, you meant to run this program? that's garbage. this would be way faster, here let me change it into that for you."
2020-09-22 20:47:18	deltasquared	and apparently various layers doing that has been a thing for mainstream computers since at least the 1980s IIRC?
2020-09-22 20:47:30	deltasquared	(compiler, out-of-order execution, cache subsystems...)
2020-09-22 20:48:22	deltasquared	mpan: I imagine in interrupt or signal handling context, if the instructions had been reordered by the compiler you could potentially see things on flag variables set before the data they're guarding is updated if you were not careful.
2020-09-22 20:48:48	deltasquared	I haven't watched the talks on myself so perhaps it's a good idea to scare myself again :D

2020-09-22 20:50:29	deltasquared	as in "this isn't atomic but still compiler please don't fecking re-order it"

2020-09-22 20:54:38	+mpan	deltasquared: not really, because volatile doesn’t tell the compiler to not re-order it or do not make funny things in cache.
2020-09-22 20:54:39	@phrik	paulguy: No results found.
2020-09-22 20:54:46	+mpan	deltasquared: volatile only tells it to the compiler.
2020-09-22 20:55:11	+mpan	deltasquared: and only volatile-marked variables are not reordered by the compiler. Other code fragments may be freely moved around across volatiles.
2020-09-22 20:55:27	deltasquared	mpan: >_>
2020-09-22 20:55:38	deltasquared	huh, welp my knowledge of what volatile does is fooked
2020-09-22 20:55:50	deltasquared	I need to re-read *that* spec too heh
2020-09-22 20:56:30	deltasquared	mpan: oh wait, I know what it can be for, it's just saying "don't remove this, it's not a dead store". IIRC I used it for some MCU registers for that reason.
2020-09-22 20:56:51	deltasquared	specifically when you had to write one thing and then the next; the compiler may think it can just skip all but the last store.
2020-09-22 20:57:07	deltasquared	so pretty much only useful for molesting mmap'd hardware
2020-09-22 20:57:29	deltasquared	why did that not come into my head immediately
2020-09-22 20:57:42	paulguy	what does the register keyword do?
2020-09-22 20:57:47	+mpan	deltasquared: a very short and quick description from gcc themselves: <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Volatiles.html>.
2020-09-22 20:57:48	deltasquared	paulguy: nothing any more :P
2020-09-22 20:57:48	@phrik	Title: Volatiles (Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)) (at gcc.gnu.org)
2020-09-22 20:58:19	paulguy	should have a gotta go fast keyword
2020-09-22 20:58:41	deltasquared	paulguy: it /used/ to be a *hint* (and was never really intended an ironcast guarantee unless it was a special "global" register variable) to try really hard not to spill a variable from a register.
2020-09-22 20:58:50	+mpan	deltasquared: so it is literally for “hey, compiler, emit code that really accesses that variable in where it is stored” and “hey compiler, ensure that all the volatile accesses are ordered as I ordered them”. But this is the practical limit of what one may expect.
2020-09-22 20:59:10	deltasquared	paulguy: so pretty much just for humans thinking they're smarter than the optimiser in most cases, hence it mostly being deprecated
2020-09-22 20:59:20	paulguy	ah
2020-09-22 20:59:32	deltasquared	mpan: oh yeah, the ordering *wrt other volatiles* is the one I forgot.
2020-09-22 20:59:44	paulguy	maybe useful on some platforms where maybe operations on memory and operations on registers may differ...
2020-09-22 20:59:49	+mpan	In particular volatile is not atomic.
2020-09-22 21:00:10	deltasquared	mpan: oh yeah *that* one I recall from a screaming warning in the docs for std::atomic<>.
2020-09-22 21:00:27	deltasquared	also C++20 changed some moar stuff about volatiles IIRC

2020-09-22 22:37:44	paulguy	i'd give him more credit than that but his focus on biochemistry probably keeps him very very busy, where introducing something else to learn may not be something he can take on, along with his other thigns he's trying to do.  also if a tool is available, there's no telling whether it's some big, expensive commercial thing.  Going by his description though and maybe some more discussion

2020-09-22 22:40:45	deltasquared	paulguy: doing something cross-discipline like that at university would have been my honour to do. you do often hear stories of non-compsci students having to learn something in a hurry on a thesis and often doing a somewhat botch job. so I would have loved to have worked on a joint project like that with someone doing one of the sciences say. or maybe something else I didn't think of, 
2020-09-22 22:40:51	deltasquared	like some mathematical simulation.

2020-09-22 22:41:32	deltasquared	heh, would have been fun explaining to a junior mathematician that regular computer float numbers aren't technically commutative or even associative in strict precision terms...
2020-09-22 22:42:00	deltasquared	not unless you whipped out a bignum library anyhow.
2020-09-22 22:42:44	paulguy	deltasquared, yeah.  and if it's well documented what its purpose is and what it does to accomplish it (in as far as it's clear and relevant to a biochemist), and released as open source code, it probably could be beneficial to a lot of less-funded projects or students doing similar work.
2020-09-22 22:43:07	deltasquared	paulguy: anyway, I think such cross-discipline projects can only become a thing at higher levels. at undergrad level it was strictly your own work or properly attributed otherwise, on pain of (academic) death
2020-09-22 22:43:31	paulguy	luckily, most development environments intended more for strict math does tend to have at least some better guarantees than native float types.
2020-09-22 22:43:33	deltasquared	(like seriously, a cross-institutional blacklist you can end up on. pretty scary stuff)
2020-09-22 22:44:18	paulguy	i'd expect proper attribution regardless what level it's at. :p
2020-09-22 22:44:25	deltasquared	paulguy: if it was something intended to be first tuned to be correct, then made to run fast, a good chunk of thesis would be on error analysis. it could be done, just has to be done the right way around.

2020-09-23 00:31:55	paulguy	and that's all i can think of
2020-09-23 00:31:56	deltasquared	you made me think M$ flight simulator 2020 had taken over all of your cpu time lel
2020-09-23 00:32:23	deltasquared	Namarrgon: did you find that on /r/taskfailedsuccessfully?
2020-09-23 00:32:33	Namarrgon	no, that's from me
2020-09-23 00:33:03	Namarrgon	all the other bugs are less amusing
2020-09-23 00:33:06	deltasquared	oh noice
2020-09-23 00:33:54	paulguy	i'm sure there are plenty of amusing geometry bugs and mistakenly modeled buildings.
2020-09-23 00:34:02	deltasquared	does anyone make a good modern control-accurate simulator that *doesn't* consume the souls of children to run properly

2020-09-23 00:35:17	deltasquared	hrm.
2020-09-23 00:35:19	paulguy	flight simulator is certainly pretty, if you don't look too closely
2020-09-23 00:35:43	deltasquared	certainly when put like that I'd rather have cpu cycles spent on physics accuracy.
2020-09-23 00:35:59	Namarrgon	paulguy: the OSM date in the village next over has a shed that is some 200m tall, it also shows up in the sim as a skyscraper

2020-09-23 00:36:12	paulguy	nice
2020-09-23 00:36:16	paulguy	i thought it used bing maps
2020-09-23 00:36:30	Namarrgon	it seems to use OSM for the landclasses
2020-09-23 00:36:40	paulguy	ah, interesting
2020-09-23 00:36:41	Namarrgon	forests, building elevation, etc
2020-09-23 00:36:52	demize	Which is something that was fixed shortly after the changeset that introduced it, but it's using old data.
2020-09-23 00:36:53	Namarrgon	the imagery is from bing
2020-09-23 00:36:56	paulguy	yeah i guess bing maps doesn't care so much about that data
2020-09-23 00:37:15	deltasquared	I do like the fact they left some of those fun bugs in

2020-09-23 00:37:35	deltasquared	Namarrgon's comment earlier suggests there are other not-so-fun game bugs
2020-09-23 00:37:49	Namarrgon	yeah, aircraft systems are a mess
2020-09-23 00:38:04	paulguy	my knowledge of msfs has ostly been watching vinesauce playing it badly. :p
2020-09-23 00:38:11	paulguy	but it does look impressive
2020-09-23 00:38:29	paulguy	and i'm sure if you take it as a more serious flight simulator, it's less janky. :p

2020-09-23 00:44:31	deltasquared	something I can buy still preferably, but if it can't be bought drm-free... well, it's like gabe newell said, you can only ever compete with piracy as it cannot be destroyed. (certainly *thus far* it hasn't been completely despite efforts...)
2020-09-23 00:44:39	HEX0	just been waiting for one of those phones with android emulator to become useable
2020-09-23 00:45:22	deltasquared	HEX0: honestly I do wonder if there'd be a compromise involving only open source apps - recompiling them instead.
2020-09-23 00:45:34	deltasquared	as in, targeting regular jvm for instance as a starting point
2020-09-23 00:45:46	deltasquared	and re-implementing the android.* namespace
2020-09-23 00:46:08	HEX0	apparently some people ran anbox on librem 5. but my guess it's janky as fuck for now
2020-09-23 00:46:18	deltasquared	obviously anything involving the ndk is out or also needs rebuilding (against glibc or such as well, that would be fun potentially)

2020-09-23 00:49:13	deltasquared	HEX0: meh, game piracy is a bit complicated when software can "fight back". I was more thinking media piracy given the ebook concept
2020-09-23 00:49:20	deltasquared	the concept still sorta holds

2020-09-23 00:57:13	deltasquared	paulguy: depends what flavours, but in general yes. vanilla is always a safe bet because it's versatile with what can be added on top.
2020-09-23 00:57:33	paulguy	the demonstration footage is all russian though so the game itself might only be russian
2020-09-23 00:57:46	deltasquared	I've done chocolate, strawberry and strangely enough coffee flavoured ice creams before now as well
2020-09-23 00:58:12	deltasquared	oh, and some of the various cookie or caramel related ben and jerry's flavours
2020-09-23 00:58:13	paulguy	you seem to have led a very sheltered ice cream life

2020-09-23 00:59:08	deltasquared	I may have tried a banana flavour once?
2020-09-23 00:59:25	deltasquared	can't remember if it was executed well
2020-09-23 00:59:28	paulguy	i do too but there isn't much in the way of ice cream I _don't_ like.
2020-09-23 00:59:39	paulguy	so i do tend to try things
2020-09-23 00:59:59	paulguy	i'm sure someone could come up with like, peas and carrots flavored ice cream
2020-09-23 01:00:37	pulec	i'm sure someone could come up with like, shoes and socks with sprinkled nails flavored ice cream
2020-09-23 01:01:15	paulguy	well sure but i was thinking of something which is actually edible and that there might be people out there who would like it.
2020-09-23 01:04:01	deltasquared	hmm, I wonder if mpv can be told to ignore pixel aspect ratio information.
2020-09-23 01:04:37	deltasquared	noticed a fair few TAS videos of PSX titles and others are apparently 320x224 internally but then mpv spits out the -> 320x240 thing.

2020-09-23 01:04:54	deltasquared	paulguy: I suspect you have had to know this before somehow? :P
2020-09-23 01:05:04	paulguy	i searched the man page for aspect
2020-09-23 01:05:22	deltasquared	I swore I saw that option earlier though and didn't see it mention 0
2020-09-23 01:05:36	deltasquared	was thinking this was something undocumented
2020-09-23 01:05:43	deltasquared	or maybe just ubuntu being crusty
2020-09-23 01:05:45	paulguy	also PS1 games probably are intended to be shown scaled to 4:3 although possibly not every game was designed with that projection in mind
2020-09-23 01:06:38	pulec	paulguy: you can eat shoes and nails
2020-09-23 01:06:42	deltasquared	paulguy: I mean I wonder if I applied my usual overlay grid tricks with it if it'd apply the filters to the raw pixel data and then scale it up.
2020-09-23 01:06:54	paulguy	ah

2020-09-23 01:07:18	deltasquared	I haven't really had a chance to try that yet; scaling up 224 or 240 to my 768 vertical pixels would require a 3x grid, and I've yet to find a good one of those.

2020-09-23 01:11:23	deltasquared	mpan: idk
2020-09-23 01:11:24	deltasquared	anyway
2020-09-23 01:11:26	deltasquared	so IIRC
2020-09-23 01:11:32	paulguy	can you make all C functions func(...) and make C a typeless langauge?
2020-09-23 01:11:36	deltasquared	in C++, empty parens means no args
2020-09-23 01:11:45	+mpan	✓
2020-09-23 01:11:45	deltasquared	in C, it means variable number of some kind?
2020-09-23 01:11:48	+mpan	✓
2020-09-23 01:11:56	+mpan	Strictly speaking: unspecified arguments.
2020-09-23 01:12:03	+Jayden	Ofcourse empty perams means no args
2020-09-23 01:12:11	+Jayden	Everyone should know that
2020-09-23 01:12:19	deltasquared	Jayden: you'd think that, but the C designers were not that logical. :P
2020-09-23 01:12:21	nshp	Jayden: except it doesn't in C :P
2020-09-23 01:12:31	+Jayden	Ik talkin bout C++
2020-09-23 01:12:46	+mpan	deltasquared: this is a valid C code: `void foo(); void user() {foo(14);}`
2020-09-23 01:12:56	+Jayden	Idk code tho
2020-09-23 01:12:57	deltasquared	Jayden: I had to point it out as comparison because the question was what the difference was between the two. :P

2020-09-23 01:13:14	+Jayden	HEX0: Thats london for ya
2020-09-23 01:13:15	pulec	I had literall 45kbit for few years
2020-09-23 01:13:23	pulec	that is 45/8 max speed
2020-09-23 01:13:24	+mpan	… because hitory, most likely because K&R and their function arguments syntax with args in the definition declared after the parens.
2020-09-23 01:13:28	+Jayden	I have 150 mbps max speed
2020-09-23 01:13:41	+mpan	nshp: yes, it is.
2020-09-23 01:13:49	+Jayden	I wish I had gigabit
2020-09-23 01:13:58	nshp	I actually kind of prefer the K&R parameter declaration syntax. it lines up really nicely with local decls
2020-09-23 01:14:01	paulguy	can you use vararg?
2020-09-23 01:14:06	HEX0	after moving I paid 40 GBP for 1.5MB/S down non duplex
2020-09-23 01:14:19	HEX0	so uploading something killed downlink
2020-09-23 01:14:28	deltasquared	mpan: makes me wonder if that is how open() is declared in <unistd.h>. y'know because it can take an optional third argument... and there's no reliance on any extensions to add optional args any other way to C in posix.
2020-09-23 01:14:37	deltasquared	only one way to find out
2020-09-23 01:14:40	+mpan	paulguy: actually… no. Not for this. The arguments will not be passad as varargs. They will be passed as if the function was declared with the parameters typed as called.
2020-09-23 01:14:52	paulguy	nshp isn't that that weirdness where it's like, type name(args) local variables { function body } ?

2020-09-23 01:15:22	+Jayden	HEX0: Downloading operating system disk images
2020-09-23 01:15:32	+mpan	paulguy: varargs require explicit ..., because that affects even what arguments are passed (in the abstract meaning), not only how they are passed at low level.
2020-09-23 01:15:32	nshp	paulguy: type name(foo, bar) int foo; int bar; { int local; body... }
2020-09-23 01:15:44	paulguy	nshp ah right yeah
2020-09-23 01:15:48	+Jayden	While a 2gb ISO image takes like 5-10 minutes those bigger files
2020-09-23 01:15:50	HEX0	Jayden: I regret upgrading from 100/100 to 300/300. honestly even with "linux isos" it's rarely useful
2020-09-23 01:15:54	paulguy	mpan oh ok
2020-09-23 01:16:13	paulguy	i don't always put local variables at the top of a function

2020-09-23 01:22:11	NoImNotNineVolt	kids thsee days
2020-09-23 01:22:25	NoImNotNineVolt	pascal was intended as a teaching language, if i'm not mistaken.
2020-09-23 01:22:41	NoImNotNineVolt	of course, you can't teach much with it nowadays.
2020-09-23 01:22:46	nshp	so was python
2020-09-23 01:22:51	NoImNotNineVolt	wat
2020-09-23 01:22:53	nshp	oops
2020-09-23 01:22:56	deltasquared	NoImNotNineVolt: I certainly was taught on it at A-level. or at least a dialect of (delphi).

2020-09-23 01:23:34	+Jayden	Python requires tons of importing libraries and installing libraries
2020-09-23 01:23:48	NoImNotNineVolt	...
2020-09-23 01:23:56	NoImNotNineVolt	you say that like it's a bad thing.
2020-09-23 01:24:09	paulguy	python does have a lot built in
2020-09-23 01:24:15	NoImNotNineVolt	have you ever written a nontrivial makefile?
2020-09-23 01:24:21	deltasquared	90's club remix of green hill zone anyone? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTNI_4nL_hE
2020-09-23 01:24:27	NoImNotNineVolt	is that somehow easier than importing a library in python? :P
2020-09-23 01:24:27	paulguy	i mean, if you want something where the build system installs all the dependencies for you there is Rust, and I think Go is the same way.
2020-09-23 01:26:53	paulguy	then in C# everyone just includes binary DLL/LIB files for everything
2020-09-23 01:26:59	nshp	if libraries are an issue I guess operating systems are out too, so maybe you should just open up your computer and try programming it by rubbing the RAM between your fingers really fast?
2020-09-23 01:27:22	nshp	heat it up, get some bit errors, you'll be at a GUI in no time
2020-09-23 01:27:25	HEX0	rust sounded very appealing to me. but not sure if it will survive another 10 years. hopefully it will get more popular
2020-09-23 01:27:33	deltasquared	Jayden: for the record, there exists something called an xyproblem where you present a problem with arbitary constraints and don't explain why, then it later turns out there's either a) another problem you were trying to solve and you got fixated on one or more potential solutions, or b) your hand is being forced externally and you're not saying so. in either case your demands here seem 
2020-09-23 01:27:39	deltasquared	arbitary and unreasonable.
2020-09-23 01:28:26	deltasquared	technically the latter case is not the classic xyproblem case but it can come across the same to bystanders.
2020-09-23 01:29:27	deltasquared	in any case until more explaination is given you're wasting everyone's time, hence the initial troll responses. :P
2020-09-23 01:29:39	deltasquared	inb4 they don't respond now

2020-09-23 01:33:05	deltasquared	it does sometimes trouble me that some people potentially aren't doing that knowingly; they're just completely untrained in digital ettiquette.

2020-09-23 01:54:47	nshp	I remember where I used to live a few people ran up against the local law against owning more than two zebras

2020-09-23 02:06:32	+mpan	HEX0: they never had majority support. They just won majority of seats in both Sejm and Senate. And in 2019 the PiS that won it was the electoral group, not the party. Strictly speaking that group is called United Right, sharing the same logotype, but PiS as the registered party is only a part of it.
2020-09-23 02:06:33	paulguy	i doubt the aesthetic is the reason why UI toolkits go out of favor.  the visual style is just a small part of a UI toolkit.
2020-09-23 02:06:48	beest	also licensing was an issue at one point, by the time it wasn't it started to be largely superceded

2020-09-23 02:07:27	+mpan	HEX0: nasty? A law that removes responsibility of authorities for any action they take, as long as they can claim they did it as a part of anti-Covid measures? Sounds bad enough?

2020-09-23 02:07:50	+mpan	HEX0: applied to past actions too, so they basically legalized their own cases of breaking the law in the past.
2020-09-23 02:07:54	paulguy	mpan, how responsible are authorities to their actions in the first place?

2020-09-23 02:18:54	+mpan	Of course those parties are still ideologically very PiS, so it’s not like I see this as a huge game changer. But if the United Right (this is the right name for it) coallition will not survive that, there will be no more union in lawmaking.

2020-09-23 02:25:54	paulguy	mpan, ah ok i see
2020-09-23 02:26:22	paulguy	yeah i could see a lot of people disagreeing with it on those grounds heh
2020-09-23 02:27:01	paulguy	first-order, i think the c64 was on average at least twice the cost of a spectrum.  the spectrum didn't even really have dedicated audio hardware.
2020-09-23 02:27:09	+mpan	paulguy: they disagree on the grounds that it is animal protection law, which is seen as a “commie thing” by that group.
2020-09-23 02:27:15	paulguy	i think you just had to like, count cycles and flip a signal high and low in software
2020-09-23 02:27:56	first-order	So at best, it was like an Atari 2600 you could program.
2020-09-23 02:28:53	first-order	No wonder the Timex version didn't gain traction in the US, it was slaughtered by its competition spec-wise.
2020-09-23 02:29:06	paulguy	the atari 2600 had more dedicated audio hardware even than the spctrum
2020-09-23 02:29:27	paulguy	however the atari 2600 _barely_ had video hardware (but more so than the zx80 had)
2020-09-23 02:29:30	+mpan	paulguy: plus a bunch of minor regulations, that give wider rights to animal welfare organisations (including removing animals from owners with the help of police), a ban on commercial animal shelters, tighter regulation on animal shelters not run by volunteers, a ban on keeping animals on a chain leash, forbidding people with criminal past to work with animals etc.
2020-09-23 02:29:47	first-order	Not by much, it's still not more capable of anymore than rudimentary SFX you could do on a PC Speaker.
2020-09-23 02:29:53	paulguy	that'll actually be a complication with zx80 emulation is the hardware is sooooo simplistic and CPU driven, that your CPU and memory bus timings have to be really tight
2020-09-23 02:30:04	first-order	*still not capable of anymore
2020-09-23 02:30:24	paulguy	first-order I mean that yo ucould write in to memory mapped registers to control some kind of synthesizer and it'll do its thing
2020-09-23 02:30:46	paulguy	rather than having to constantly feed it signal transitions
2020-09-23 02:32:40	HEX0	hopefully belarus breaks away from that shit

2020-09-23 02:51:46	+mpan	The system is totally ineffective, though, as it’s a simple DNS redirection.
2020-09-23 02:51:54	+mpan	ISP’s DNS redirection*
2020-09-23 02:52:32	+mpan	If you are not using a Polish ISP’s DNS, you are not affected. And if you do, you are redirected to a state website with a warning. Which of course doesn’t work, because it can’t produce the right TLS certificate.

2020-09-23 02:53:11	+mpan	In Poland it is legal to gamble only on state-owned websites.
2020-09-23 02:53:17	paulguy	and you'd have to lie about taxes
2020-09-23 02:53:32	+mpan	Because yes, state organizes lotteries.
2020-09-23 02:53:45	paulguy	well yeah that's gambling but it's not like
2020-09-23 02:53:50	paulguy	dice or cards or anything
2020-09-23 02:54:01	+mpan	You can also gamble in the meatspace, as long as the place obtained a relevant license.

2020-09-23 02:54:46	paulguy	nevada does.  new york does.  others might i dunno.
2020-09-23 02:55:06	+mpan	It’s a different scope, as you can’t really put arbitrary amount of money into the game, so the damage is spread across many years.
2020-09-23 02:55:19	HEX0	mpan: here they block via DNS  a few torrent websites and movie streaming sites. not sure they about foreign sites. but yeah a DNS change solves it
2020-09-23 02:55:44	paulguy	but we also have the stock market. :p
2020-09-23 02:55:50	+mpan	And the money goes to the good, law-abiding, society-loving directors of various sport organizations, not those filthy private people.

2020-09-23 02:55:59	+mpan	Yes, and Forex.
2020-09-23 02:56:12	paulguy	i think gambling on sports is generally illegal too

2020-09-23 03:30:33	xulfer	it's sad that i have to say that
2020-09-23 03:30:41	HEX0	paulguy: for example nazi party and the wehrmacht army
2020-09-23 03:30:43	xulfer	hell by todays standards Bush wasn't so bad

2020-09-23 03:31:20	xulfer	paulguy: saying that in reference to what i said or hex?
2020-09-23 03:31:26	paulguy	yeah, no dictators, just massive brainwashing. :p
2020-09-23 03:31:31	paulguy	xulfer, you
2020-09-23 03:31:37	xulfer	svito: well we kind of almost made FDR president for life
2020-09-23 03:31:42	HEX0	paulguy: nazis created the following. and army obeyed the goverment
2020-09-23 03:31:54	paulguy	bush legitimately ordered and had boots on the ground.
2020-09-23 03:32:07	xulfer	yeah but bush was mostly inept
2020-09-23 03:32:13	svito	xulfer: he had limited powers though and democratically elected
2020-09-23 03:32:14	xulfer	but he wasn't evil imo
2020-09-23 03:32:34	paulguy	i mean "evil" is a pretty silly way to analyze behavior.
2020-09-23 03:32:38	svito	usually dictators well dictate through rule by decree
2020-09-23 03:32:50	xulfer	svito: yeah i mean you're right, and my point was that FDR didn't WANT to be president for life.  He was elected over and over out of necessity
2020-09-23 03:32:53	svito	or by fear
2020-09-23 03:33:07	xulfer	that's what made him a good president
2020-09-23 03:33:27	paulguy	yeah, trump has been doing a good bit more "ruling by decree", where bush just went around congress to start a war.
2020-09-23 03:33:38	horseface	this is so weird.

2020-09-23 03:39:15	paulguy	because there would be something wrong with that
2020-09-23 03:39:23	xulfer	he was asking to chat on discord and i was drunk so i was like... eh why not
2020-09-23 03:39:30	horseface	fuck i'm reconfiguring my JACK parameters... i had it at 2ms latency and 128 periods per whatever... and i dropped it back to 256...

2020-09-23 03:40:59	horseface	oh man i cannot say exactly how i decided on using this nick. i would have to say that drugs played a part.
2020-09-23 03:41:11	horseface	this nick i created about a decade ago now...
2020-09-23 03:41:20	paulguy	most people know how i look

2020-09-23 03:41:48	xulfer	yeah my nick is ages old... i mean i know how i came up with it but it's a tale that started like 20 years ago
2020-09-23 03:41:51	paulguy	2ms is easy if nothing is playing
2020-09-23 03:41:54	horseface	would spit from the kernel.

2020-09-23 03:42:38	xulfer	i was reflux on efnet when i was a teen.  Then the trend came about when people would reverse their nicks
2020-09-23 03:42:47	xulfer	so i became xulfer and just never changed back
2020-09-23 03:42:50	horseface	just that... once in twelve hours it may start making static sound.

2020-09-23 07:30:54	+mpan	paulguy: the funny thing when I was young and analog TV was still in use, was that our cable TV had some channels in PAL, some in SECAM.
2020-09-23 07:31:11	+mpan	You had to manually set those in the TV set for each channel.
2020-09-23 07:31:22	paulguy	mpan it's not like it was _that_ long ago.
2020-09-23 07:31:22	+mpan	Good that the device at least had such settings and stored them.
2020-09-23 07:31:39	+mpan	In my memory it is, considering that I do not have a TV for over a decade.
2020-09-23 07:31:51	paulguy	analog broadcast stopped here in 2007 and there was basic analog TV in to the 2010s
2020-09-23 07:32:03	paulguy	er, basic analog cable TV
2020-09-23 07:32:26	+mpan	Yeah, quite likely. But I simply remember the TV from when I was young.
2020-09-23 07:33:10	paulguy	ah.  we had analog TV until the very end, then we got the converter box, so we were still dealing with NTSC video. :p
2020-09-23 07:33:30	paulguy	because it was composite video out of the box
2020-09-23 07:34:13	+mpan	I have no idea what my parents’ TVs are using. It goes through SCART and I was never investigating what is actually used now.
2020-09-23 07:34:30	+mpan	(SCART is that weird European connector)
2020-09-23 07:34:39	+mpan	Weird and inconvenient.
2020-09-23 07:35:55	paulguy	SCART had some neat benefits, and drawbacks.
2020-09-23 07:36:14	+mpan	Oh, I am not saying that the connector itself is totally stupid. Just that it is inconvenient and kinda weird.
2020-09-23 07:36:22	paulguy	neat in that you could pretty much plug most thigns in to most things and there would be _some_ signal.
2020-09-23 07:36:33	+mpan	And it always looks as if it was going to fall away from the socket. :P
2020-09-23 07:36:41	paulguy	but all kinds of variables could cause a low quality "negotiation".
2020-09-23 07:38:22	paulguy	and a lot of low cost computers and things would fly fast and loose with standards
2020-09-23 07:38:48	paulguy	but yeah it looks like a really primitive printer cable
2020-09-23 07:39:11	paulguy	or something for like, automotive use
2020-09-23 07:39:21	paulguy	like a diagnostic port for a 70s car

2020-09-23 07:41:05	paulguy	pretty sure it was 2007 but i could be wrong.  I remember i was still living with grandma then and i had to help her with the coupon and picking up the box or something.
2020-09-23 07:41:20	paulguy	and by 2009 she already had had a stroke

2020-09-23 07:47:42	paulguy	would be cool if it had music videos for the songs it was playing
2020-09-23 07:47:56	paulguy	a I guess proper MTV
2020-09-23 07:48:36	paulguy	could bring out the CRT TV, rabbit ears and relive that 90s experience of just sitting around listening to music videos
2020-09-23 07:48:38	paulguy	:p
2020-09-23 07:49:36	paulguy	and the video will be soft and crusty
2020-09-23 07:50:03	paulguy	although if it's put out from a computer it'll probably look kinda bad.  something about how computers encode analog video just looks weird and bad.
2020-09-23 07:50:36	paulguy	i'm guessing there's a bunch of enhancements and stuff built in that try to make stuff like websites and presentations look clearer but it just makes everything look awful

2020-09-23 08:13:48	+mpan	4 TV channels is enough for everyone!
2020-09-23 08:14:17	paulguy	i had 6 (worth watching)

2020-09-23 08:15:04	paulguy	the other 2 were PBS and the the religious station
2020-09-23 08:16:23	+mpan	TV Trwam, the ultracatholic TV of Poland, was among the first to get position on the digital channels. And they were always having the strongest signal. Even now their radio is still the strongest.
2020-09-23 08:16:51	+mpan	But I had more when I was young and the communist era has ended.

2020-09-23 08:29:14	paulguy	what's a fapi
2020-09-23 08:29:47	grawity	"feature api" (high-level access to tpm2)
2020-09-23 08:30:10	paulguy	oh
2020-09-23 08:30:16	paulguy	and eapi?
2020-09-23 08:30:42	paulguy	i think i remember the link this is in response to and it was just word soup
2020-09-23 08:30:53	grawity	oh wait, it's esapi I think
2020-09-23 08:30:57	paulguy	security is complicated.
2020-09-23 08:31:43	grawity	low-level access where you directly work with C functions that correspond to the tpm2 hardware functions (which imo look fairly ugly)
2020-09-23 08:32:25	paulguy	i dunno anything about TPM
2020-09-23 08:32:32	paulguy	i know my motherboard has a header for it
2020-09-23 08:33:49	Tom^	i dont know much about tpm either besides it having a option in bios
2020-09-23 08:33:51	Tom^	:D
2020-09-23 08:33:54	Tom^	what is it good for
2020-09-23 08:34:40	paulguy	yeah i figured it was just some addon you have to buy from the manufacturer
2020-09-23 08:35:05	grawity	Tom^: a) storing private keys non-extractably, like a smartcard or a yubikey; b) storing data that can only be unsealed when the system is in a specific state, like a LUKS key that you can only get when the system is booted from the system disk but not from a usb stick
2020-09-23 08:35:36	Tom^	oh and it is secure?
2020-09-23 08:35:49	Tom^	sounds interesting might abuse it on my thinkpud then
2020-09-23 08:35:52	grawity	anyway, the actual tpm2 functions (and accordingly, sapi/esapi library functions) are often a bit obscure – took me a week to understand what CreatePrimary does, and I still don't remember the difference between Load and LoadExternal
2020-09-23 08:36:38	grawity	so fapi is a simplified library that you just call e.g. CreateKey and it does whatever operations are necessary to create a key
2020-09-23 08:37:28	grawity	Tom^: the chip itself is supposed to be secure, but on desktops apparently you can just tap the unsealed data going through that pin header, so :/
2020-09-23 08:37:58	Tom^	oh heh
2020-09-23 08:38:21	grawity	but I think there *are* ways to protect against that in tpm2, and in any case it's good enough for casual disk encryption anyway
2020-09-23 08:38:51	grawity	and it doesn't affect private key operations, i.e. the key still cannot be extracted that way
2020-09-23 08:38:54	paulguy	business casual

2020-09-23 08:47:55	paulguy	may as well smash them and create more landfill
2020-09-23 08:48:50	grawity	sounds like one of those cases where you pick up a single word and completely misunderstand the point from it, so I'll ignore that
2020-09-23 08:49:15	paulguy	so there is a way to reset such a locked system?
2020-09-23 08:49:18	grawity	the point is, bitlocker doesn't prevent a computer from working
2020-09-23 08:49:35	paulguy	i figured it was like the iphone protection
2020-09-23 08:49:39	jescis	grawity: because the code/key is unknown to us and no one has come and got rid of the bitlocker screen
2020-09-23 08:49:42	grawity	if you own the computer, you can just clean wipe the disk and reinstall the OS, just like if you forgot the LUKS password
2020-09-23 08:50:02	paulguy	since iphones brick themselves if they're reported stolen
2020-09-23 08:50:11	paulguy	or if they were locked

2020-09-23 08:53:57	paulguy	yeah if you have no access to the password or key or whatever, the data's as good as gone more or less, unless there's some unofficial password cracker. :p

2020-09-23 09:09:09	jescis	I felt like I was in a catch-22(at the time) :\
2020-09-23 09:09:15	+mpan	jescis: speaking of BitLocker: if you could easily circumvent BitLocker, what would be the purpose of it? Just wipe it out. You must wipe the whole drive anyway for privacy/security reasons, so…
2020-09-23 09:10:40	jescis	mpan: to be able to use the computer as before bitlocker was enabled
2020-09-23 09:10:45	novns	jescis, and you can start as a freelancer on upwork, for example
2020-09-23 09:10:50	+mpan	jescis: the “2 years of experience” thing is not a Catch-22 case. It’s usually to deter people who are not sure of their skill or not having any skill at all. If you can *show* actual experience, like what novns has suggested, in most places this should give you a job. Though I know in some countreis indeed they may have some weird requirements, like a degree.
2020-09-23 09:11:10	+mpan	jescis: ArchISO or any other live distro?
2020-09-23 09:12:49	+mpan	Just write the whole drive with “/dev/urandom”, then execute ATA Secure Erase. Note that both operations may take a while, so you may even consider running a bunch of disks in parallel for that purpose.
2020-09-23 09:12:53	jescis	Can't get to the login screen with it enabled... I could try it(ArchISO)
2020-09-23 09:13:26	+mpan	Filling the drive with random data will also ensure bad sectors are likely to be detected, so you will be able to determine the state of the drive.
2020-09-23 09:16:59	jescis	Well, right now the place where the computer is, is closed because of someone not at the place getting COVID-19! Now I'm stuck away from said place until they open it again!
2020-09-23 09:17:06	+mpan	ATA Secure Erase can be done in parallel for very large number of disks (as many as you can connect). Filling with “/dev/urandom” consumes bandwidth of your SATA controller, so here you are limited to how much it can handle in parallel.
2020-09-23 09:18:35	jescis	mpan: thanks for the advice
2020-09-23 09:19:01	+mpan	Both are needed, because they are complementary. Filling the disk is certainly working, but you may not be able to access all aras. ATA Secure Erase may access those areas, but some drives have it badly implemented or outright faked…
2020-09-23 09:20:14	+mpan	Also if using some motherboards, like older Gigabyte ones, keep in mind they may report false drive size, as they silently reserve a part of it for BIOS recovery data. If possible disable that, if not… well, hope ATA SE will take care of that area.

2020-09-23 09:37:07	+mpan	I am assuming at that point, that at this point everything is locked with BitLocker. If this is just a part of the drive and smehow you can retain Windows installation, there might be a way to wipe/remove everythng else without removing Windows itself. But this is beyond my knowledge.

2020-09-23 10:50:55	grawity	since it's a flat text file, it's up to you to find the messages that correspond to the previous boot

2020-09-23 13:46:06	jelle	iirc this issue was something on my system which was fubar
2020-09-23 13:46:11	andrewSC	i used to write it professionally
2020-09-23 13:46:20	deltasquared	I'm just glad I worked at a software dev place last which had competent people and knew which languages were horrid abominations... PHP and so on were the subject of many jokes about creative punishments heh

2020-09-23 13:46:47	andrewSC	lolol
2020-09-23 13:46:49	jelle	andrewSC: this is some legacy php
2020-09-23 13:46:56	jelle	most modern stuff is golang/python/Js
2020-09-23 13:46:57	andrewSC	even better
2020-09-23 13:47:44	jelle	hmm I thought we made xapian optional
2020-09-23 13:47:49	andrewSC	i had to modify a "closed" source open-source project for werk a couple years ago.. was php and written extremely shittily
2020-09-23 13:48:02	zaszi	is their PHP that is not written shittily?
2020-09-23 13:48:05	zaszi	there*
2020-09-23 13:48:17	andrewSC	zaszi: unironically yes, but it's rare as hell
2020-09-23 13:48:18	+dp	harsh
2020-09-23 13:48:39	zaszi	afaik that whole language evolved as systems and frameworks piled on each other, not to mention that the average PHP developer are random hobbyists who maaaaaaaybe followed *a class*
2020-09-23 13:48:42	andrewSC	and usually comes with a BDFL that hawks over every PR
2020-09-23 13:48:49	zaszi	so the code quality of most of the online stuff is abominable at best

2020-09-23 13:51:43	+dp	moolah to be made
2020-09-23 13:51:48	zaszi	also obviously I'm generalizing here, but in my experience PHP devs were also by far the most annoying group who outright fucking *refused* to learn anything outside of their domain
2020-09-23 13:51:51	+dp	a fool and his money?
2020-09-23 13:51:59	zaszi	zero ops knowledge, zero network knowledge, and sometimes even zero computer knowledge
2020-09-23 13:52:03	+dp	lols
2020-09-23 13:52:03	andrewSC	they shall part ways
2020-09-23 13:52:28	zaszi	ex-coworker chmod -R 777 / his entire machine, twice
2020-09-23 13:52:28	+dp	I'm a developer, why the fuck should I know anything about ops!
2020-09-23 13:52:31	deltasquared	zaszi: "not their job to know" people?
2020-09-23 13:52:32	zaszi	to fix some drupal permission issues
2020-09-23 13:52:37	opt1mus	hahaha
2020-09-23 13:52:39	zaszi	deltasquared: yes
2020-09-23 13:52:50	andrewSC	zaszi: who needs ops and general understanding of context when you have php? isn't everything just created and destroyed on every request?
2020-09-23 13:52:51	andrewSC	;)
2020-09-23 13:53:04	seankhliao	dp time to get in on the devops $$$
2020-09-23 13:53:18	zaszi	andrewSC: I was ops back then, queue 10 times a day of the good ol' "but it works on my machine!"
2020-09-23 13:53:19	+dp	I write code, it's someone else's job on the other side of that there manure-fence to get my code into prod and see it through
2020-09-23 13:53:29	andrewSC	lolol
2020-09-23 13:53:30	zaszi	and their web app completely kills the server

2020-09-23 13:53:58	deltasquared	so also glad I had *reasonable* infosec and QA departments at my last job so anyone doing something as dumb as e.g. a chmod -R ... / would get fired.
2020-09-23 13:54:03	andrewSC	"Yeahh.... i'm gonna need you to try a couple different browsers before you come back on this issue.. thanksssss"
2020-09-23 13:54:07	+dp	meanwhile ops is the other way around
2020-09-23 13:54:23	zaszi	devs with zero ops knowledge and ops with zero dev knowledge are a massive pain in the ass as coworkers
2020-09-23 13:54:34	andrewSC	agreed...
2020-09-23 13:54:34	+dp	Hi, I'm a devops engineer
2020-09-23 13:54:47	andrewSC	hello
2020-09-23 13:54:50	+dp	it means I'm everyone's bitch
2020-09-23 13:54:52	andrewSC	hahahahahaha
2020-09-23 13:55:05	andrewSC	my feels
2020-09-23 13:55:07	+dp	devops is just a spitroast innit
2020-09-23 13:55:17	zaszi	well, if you have a devops profile and you are treated like shit, just move to one of the million open jobs for devops where, you know, you are not treated like shit
2020-09-23 13:55:21	+dp	it's what it feels like sometimes
2020-09-23 13:55:21	zaszi	there's more demand than supply
2020-09-23 13:55:28	andrewSC	man i went from full stack to devops and i honestly like it more...
2020-09-23 13:55:29	+dp	zaszi, indeed
2020-09-23 13:55:35	+dp	gotta build that cv
2020-09-23 13:55:50	+dp	andrewSC, I went from embedded sw to devops and I like it better
2020-09-23 13:55:54	+dp	\o/
2020-09-23 13:55:55	deltasquared	I'm getting increasingly paranoid that the last job I had was a paradise of sanity that I decided to leave due to illness and likely would not be able to return to.
2020-09-23 13:56:02	+dp	lols deltasquared 
2020-09-23 13:56:03	andrewSC	mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm nicenicenice
2020-09-23 13:56:04	+dp	truths
2020-09-23 13:56:10	+dp	from what you've told me about it 
2020-09-23 13:56:17	zaszi	no job is a paradise. You just weren't there long enough to see the misery :P
2020-09-23 13:56:26	zaszi	that said, there's definitely a scale though
2020-09-23 13:56:29	andrewSC	i feel this is also accurate
2020-09-23 13:56:44	+dp	a spectrum
2020-09-23 13:56:54	andrewSC	i've had unbearable jobs but incredible, incredible co-workers that made it bearable
2020-09-23 13:57:11	andrewSC	basically "we're all suffering together"
2020-09-23 13:57:12	deltasquared	zaszi: the only misery there appeared to be was the constant shadow of lay-offs to line shareholder pockets, y'know the usual
2020-09-23 13:57:13	andrewSC	hahah
2020-09-23 13:57:15	+dp	not different severities of dysfunction, just different colours
2020-09-23 13:57:18	andrewSC	afk a bit
2020-09-23 13:57:49	zaszi	deltasquared: oof
2020-09-23 13:58:55	deltasquared	zaszi: 's the reason I don't really want to go back anyway. I was offered money to leave quietly but didn't like what I saw in the paperwork, so on that grounds but also ongoing illness I quit.
2020-09-23 13:59:42	zaszi	deltasquared: yeah I recall you explaining
2020-09-23 13:59:59	deltasquared	the team I worked with were always great
2020-09-23 14:00:23	zaszi	but just coworkers does not a business make
2020-09-23 14:00:30	deltasquared	indeed
2020-09-23 14:00:32	zaszi	way too many variables that can suck
2020-09-23 14:00:46	+dp	did they buy you a foosball table though
2020-09-23 14:00:55	+dp	or some beanbags
2020-09-23 14:01:06	+dp	that makes all the problems go away
2020-09-23 14:01:08	zaszi	the biggest saving grace we IT people have over many other sectors though is that for decently experienced profiles, the worker supply has yet to match demands
2020-09-23 14:01:18	zaszi	so you can demand better working conditions than average
2020-09-23 14:01:22	zaszi	and can easily switch

2020-09-23 14:32:13	grawity	it won't disconnect you, but freenode has ~46700 channels, so it's going to suck to scroll through
2020-09-23 14:32:23	grawity	freenode has "/msg alis list somewordhere" for search
2020-09-23 14:32:39	opt1mus	I just ran it out of curiosity, and it handles it much better than I recall
2020-09-23 14:32:48	gabbe1237	whait what does "hog your irc client" mean?
2020-09-23 14:33:10	deltasquared	gabbe1237: it takes ages to transfer and may increase latency, flood your chat, or cause other issues
2020-09-23 14:33:18	grawity	it used to be that requesting a massive /list would outright disconnect you, as the server queued more data than the limit allowed
2020-09-23 14:33:19	opt1mus	you'll end up with reems of scrollup, it use to slow clients down, but it's a lot better these days

2020-09-23 14:33:48	opt1mus	yep alis is much better way of searching
2020-09-23 14:33:50	grawity	though it won't make irssi/weechat *clients* slow – they just treat it as text
2020-09-23 14:34:09	deltasquared	hexchat generally handles it quite well if it's expecting such a query
2020-09-23 14:34:14	+dp	ha ha channels go brrr
2020-09-23 14:34:21	deltasquared	otherwise it just dumps it at the main server log
2020-09-23 14:34:26	grawity	okay I just tried it and it took ~20 seconds
2020-09-23 14:34:41	opt1mus	yeah similar here, and masses of scrollup
2020-09-23 14:34:46	deltasquared	say, does irssi have a facility to run a command and dump it to a file
2020-09-23 14:34:49	deltasquared	caching it may be of use
2020-09-23 14:35:02	deltasquared	or maybe just temporarily start logging
2020-09-23 14:35:09	grawity	though /list is not the whole 47k channels, plenty have marked themselves as hidden (+s)
2020-09-23 14:35:27	grawity	deltasquared: yeah I don't remember the exact commands, but /help log
2020-09-23 14:35:59	gabbe1237	Can you make your own server or channel for friends or something similar?
2020-09-23 14:36:31	opt1mus	both
2020-09-23 14:36:47	opt1mus	but it might be easier to create a channel on an existing server
2020-09-23 14:36:55	opt1mus	all you do is join it
2020-09-23 14:37:03	opt1mus	so; /j #myawesomechannel
2020-09-23 14:37:27	opt1mus	freenode site should have all the admin commands you need to adjust access rights etc

2020-09-23 15:10:42	Namarrgon	Foxboron: have you asked if they would provide a desk/chair?
2020-09-23 15:10:47	deltasquared	or 5:2 so at 80cm deep they don't fit into the recess I have in my room)

2020-09-23 15:16:47	deltasquared	th0rne: I'd probably bind win-shift-S
2020-09-23 15:16:59	opt1mus	okay that's probably better...
2020-09-23 15:17:24	th0rne	Ok, thanks for the ideas.
2020-09-23 15:17:31	deltasquared	maybe throw in ctrl as extra precaution, as win-S is an sxhkd shortcut for telling bspwm to let a window float
2020-09-23 15:17:46	deltasquared	and shift is used for some second-level actions with window management
2020-09-23 15:17:53	th0rne	I only just realized that I have some very easily accessible combos unbound.
2020-09-23 15:18:11	deltasquared	so maybe ctrl would be my "alt command" modifier in that case as opposed to simply doing something different with a window
2020-09-23 15:18:28	th0rne	For instance super+tab and super+esc, where super is winkey.
2020-09-23 15:18:30	deltasquared	th0rne: in general I reserve super-key combos for the window manager
2020-09-23 15:18:35	th0rne	Hmm.
2020-09-23 15:18:38	deltasquared	seeing as a lot of DEs hook into super anyway
2020-09-23 15:18:49	th0rne	I see.
2020-09-23 15:18:58	deltasquared	so apps basically never use it
2020-09-23 15:19:07	deltasquared	it's de facto reserved for the DE/WM keybinds
2020-09-23 15:19:12	deltasquared	might as well put that to use
2020-09-23 15:19:28	opt1mus	I used to just run scrot with a delay
2020-09-23 15:19:32	th0rne	Right, yes.
2020-09-23 15:19:38	deltasquared	that said, I myself could not totally do without F-keys as I VT switch a fair bit.
2020-09-23 15:19:41	deltasquared	opt1mus: I do that too, yes
2020-09-23 15:19:57	deltasquared	the beep from the terminal bell in that case is very useful
2020-09-23 15:20:04	opt1mus	very
2020-09-23 15:20:08	th0rne	I mean I have fn+1 for f1 and so on.
2020-09-23 15:20:08	deltasquared	well, on my desktop it's not a beeper, but an LED
2020-09-23 15:20:10	+SysGhost	Foxboron: brainfart?
2020-09-23 15:20:19	deltasquared	turns out you can wire an LED across the pcspkr pins just fine
2020-09-23 15:20:25	deltasquared	it's current limited so it won't blow up
2020-09-23 15:20:29	Foxboron	SysGhost: :D
2020-09-23 15:20:42	deltasquared	so instead of annoying chirps from my system, I see flashes
2020-09-23 15:20:43	+SysGhost	I've had those too. Poured tea into my glass of juice once.
2020-09-23 15:21:00	opt1mus	:D as someone here found out; your common LEDs don't seem to like being driven over 24v
2020-09-23 15:21:03	deltasquared	I prefer the LED flash in general, it's visible in my periphery without being annoying
2020-09-23 15:21:22	+SysGhost	Another time I put the beer in the WC room and the toilet paper in the fridge.
2020-09-23 15:22:08	opt1mus	I've stood at our coffee island, put a tea bag in my mug, chatting away.. then poured coffee into it

2020-09-23 15:23:13	deltasquared	opt1mus: the folks at ##electronics reckon that the pcspkr pins on most motherboards have current limiting. not sure why myself. still, it turned out to be true on my system, so just a random green 5mm LED I had around, wedged into a lego technic beam, and screwed to case front
2020-09-23 15:23:50	opt1mus	nice, much less obnoxious

2020-09-23 15:24:29	+SysGhost	deltasquared: it has current-limiting features. I know by experience. Once upon a time I shorted it by accident, and the trace in the motherboards smoldered rigorously before burstning into flames and then it all went back to normal, but without the speaker functionality.
2020-09-23 15:24:36	opt1mus	an device being developed here ought to run over 24v, so someone upped the voltage on the PSU, while LEDs were also attached "there's smoke coming out of it"
2020-09-23 15:24:43	opt1mus	s/an/a
2020-09-23 15:26:06	+SysGhost	Motherboard survived thanks for the trace being so thin.
2020-09-23 15:26:28	opt1mus	hehe, that reminds me, a unit was sent in for repair under warranty, 24v device, the customer sent it in with an interested mod; they had cut the proper connector off, and it had a three pin wall socket plug on it, for 240v... yeaaaaah THAT might be why it failed

2020-09-23 15:28:58	opt1mus	SysGhost: lol
2020-09-23 15:29:25	deltasquared	technically the lego axle holes are 4.9mm so it's friction fitted there
2020-09-23 15:29:32	deltasquared	hence why it's not in all the way
2020-09-23 15:29:39	+SysGhost	I know. Takes quite some force still.
2020-09-23 15:30:50	+SysGhost	It'll keep the smoke in for sure.
2020-09-23 15:30:54	deltasquared	the only disadvantage is you can no longer derive bios error codes from beep frequency if some patterns are similar. but tbh if that happened I'd probably get the speaker module out and look through the manual for the obvious candidates anyway
2020-09-23 15:31:08	deltasquared	SysGhost: no smoke so far... :D
2020-09-23 15:31:16	deltasquared	as long as those legs stay apart
2020-09-23 15:31:32	deltasquared	they're actually pretty rigid once the led is fixated so I'm not that worried.
2020-09-23 15:31:53	deltasquared	even when I muck around with the hdplex's cables there behind it they don't budge
2020-09-23 15:32:26	+SysGhost	Until you need to readjust some cable, and without noticing moving the long legs towards the case ground. 
2020-09-23 15:32:31	deltasquared	if i got paranoid I guess I could snip the leads until they only just protude from the breadboard cables there.
2020-09-23 15:33:45	deltasquared	opt1mus: re that "mod", so many people obviouly thing it'll "only use the volts it needs"
2020-09-23 15:33:53	deltasquared	"no sir, that only works for current"
2020-09-23 15:34:56	+SysGhost	green LEDs tend to turn into the yellow and orange area when they're overvolted. (I might know that by experience)
2020-09-23 15:35:46	deltasquared	SysGhost: right. well on this system at least the intentional current limiting is doing it's job. the current limit happens to be in a comfy range for the LED AFAIK. the multimeter shows a safe voltage across it after the limiting.
2020-09-23 15:37:01	deltasquared	(AFAIK in this case being holding down backspace on a logged in tty then current mode multimeter inline to see what was going on)
2020-09-23 15:37:02	+SysGhost	Tested the current? shouldn't be above 20 mA or therearound
2020-09-23 15:37:17	deltasquared	I don't recall the exact figure other than "eh that should be fine"
2020-09-23 15:37:26	+SysGhost	ah!... godd enough!
2020-09-23 15:37:48	+SysGhost	No smoke or no weird high pitched noises = fine!
2020-09-23 15:38:04	deltasquared	of all the things I could short the pcspkr lines are the last thing I worried about
2020-09-23 15:38:27	deltasquared	once I shorted the hdplex's 12v bus via a barrel plug I'd hooked up for my HTC vive pre.
2020-09-23 15:38:37	deltasquared	let a threaded rod roll over and fzzt
2020-09-23 15:38:55	deltasquared	the hdplex psu emitted a rubbery sounding shriek before cutting out
2020-09-23 15:39:25	deltasquared	bar a rude reset the system seemed otherwise fine and has been for a good year since that mishap
2020-09-23 15:39:30	+SysGhost	that's the short-protection shrieking. Sometimes it shreaks too late and everything still emit smoke.
2020-09-23 15:40:08	deltasquared	SysGhost: at least hdplex are serious about their protection features. other less well-made DC PSUs would probably have gone bang.
2020-09-23 15:42:01	+SysGhost	That'll be interesting with the upcoming high-current 12v-only PSUs that is to come. They can handle quite some currents (60-120 amps no probs). Wonder how the short-protection is going to work there.
2020-09-23 15:42:41	deltasquared	gah, quite frankly I hope the 12VO spec stays in prebuilts. it's just shenanigans for ill-written laws IIRC.

2020-09-23 15:45:18	+SysGhost	Many motherboard vendors nowadays do use onboard DCDC converters of good quality rather than relying on a user-chosen PSU with god knows what kind of voltage-levels/ripple.
2020-09-23 15:45:25	+SysGhost	...so it's understandable.
2020-09-23 15:46:25	+SysGhost	So many home-made systems that cheap out on the PSU still.
2020-09-23 15:47:00	deltasquared	on the flip side making a split DC setup for small builds on 12V would be easier. heck you could just have the 12V in on the DC jack.
2020-09-23 15:47:34	+rcf	SysGhost: it’s fun to explain to people that their cheating out on the power supply is, in fact, what killed their otherwise expensive system 
2020-09-23 15:47:41	deltasquared	though this is admittedly different from the existing standard 19v power bricks used for such SFF builds and would require a hecking good 12v brick if that goes directly to pcie slot power.

2020-09-23 15:50:11	deltasquared	so you might have options for step-down modules for sata power and such if a 12VO board is lacking in power connectors itself.
2020-09-23 15:51:59	+SysGhost	deltasquared: the 12vo standard has only the conectors for the board and PCIe power. Rest is up to the builder/mortherboar vendor to solve. I'd imagine there will be separate DC-DC covnerters one can add to it, and some motherboards will have "pheriperals power out" for hard drives, SSD's etc.
2020-09-23 15:52:49	MrElendig	will mostly be a oem thing, but I suspect some itx boards will pick it up too
2020-09-23 15:52:58	deltasquared	SysGhost: being "stuck" with the motherboard's impl of those peripheral step-down voltages was the thing that had me most concerned with 12VO but with the presence of pcie power connectors it could at least be worked around.
2020-09-23 15:53:01	MrElendig	itx and other sff boards
2020-09-23 15:53:05	+SysGhost	Many preconfigured systems already use that method. I only have to look at our old Dell desktop machines here. They're kind of 12vo although not ATX standard. Then the motherboard have all the power outlets.
2020-09-23 15:53:24	MrElendig	difference now is that there is an actual standard for it
2020-09-23 15:53:34	MrElendig	everyone have been doing it in servers for years too
2020-09-23 15:53:39	deltasquared	MrElendig: yeah see I was just thinking that; for SFF builds it makes way more sense because m.2 is the popular format there, and as SysGhost stated above boards have been doing the 3.3 for m.2 drives themselves for ages.
2020-09-23 15:54:39	deltasquared	SysGhost: I actually sort of have such an itx board already, albeit it can take either 12v or 19v (but has to be switched over to do so - presumably it may pass through the 12v input to the drives directly?)

2020-09-23 15:54:55	deltasquared	and it has a couple of on-board sata power connectors
2020-09-23 15:55:50	deltasquared	the idea being you just hook up a bog standard 19v brick at the back and forget about it in a "business" setting (it's aimed at thin client machines)
2020-09-23 15:56:28	+SysGhost	Some hard drives (the larger 3.5" ones) already adapted and use 12v only, and use it's own onboard 3.3v covnersion. Due to many systems lacking the 3.3v pins on the sata power.
2020-09-23 15:57:46	deltasquared	SysGhost: m.2 to 2.5" adapters already do this precisely because of few manufacturers bother wiring up 3.3v
2020-09-23 15:57:53	deltasquared	somehow it just ended up defacto missing
2020-09-23 15:58:49	deltasquared	shame many of them do so via linear regs. dropping hopefully the 5v to 3.3v at the 2A some drives need... they be getting hot
2020-09-23 15:59:07	+SysGhost	haha...
2020-09-23 15:59:09	+SysGhost	thaT
2020-09-23 15:59:40	deltasquared	shenanigans like that are why 12VO doing the same thing to the 5v line didn't get me particularly hopeful in those cases.
2020-09-23 15:59:41	+SysGhost	30w linear regulation from 12 to 5... aaah it won't get that hot...
2020-09-23 16:00:25	deltasquared	heatsinked 2.5 -> 3.5 caddy!     *heatsinking used for linear regulator, pls gib airflow

2020-09-23 16:04:13	deltasquared	that reminds me, I need to do some more shopping for docking solutions. to avoid wear on future SSDs's data connectors and also and not deal with shitty m.2 -> 2.5" adapters, gonna "wrap" my growing ssd collection in some optical bay caddies instead.
2020-09-23 16:04:33	deltasquared	which means I now need a docking solution to put something slimline optical sized into for my desktop...
2020-09-23 16:04:53	deltasquared	I imagine hotswap bays for swapping an optical drive itself are not that common lel
2020-09-23 16:05:48	deltasquared	stuff to fit into a slimline optical bay that changes *that* into a hotswap bay, sure, but that brings up durability issues on the drive itself.

2020-09-23 18:38:41	+SysGhost	Sometimes it happens the laptops have a memory lapse and forget their keys (stored safely within a chip in the computer). The only thing left is to wipe it clean and initalize the default image. User data are usually synced to the servers so that isn't lost anyway.

2020-09-23 18:55:01	+mpan	jescis: if the 1.50V RAM can sustain 1.65V, you can — at the cost of higher temperature and lower expected life. But I doubt it can. If you can run 1.65V RAM at 1.50V with reduced clock and timings (may require manual tweaking), you can.
2020-09-23 18:55:53	+mpan	In the latter case you should test the new setup with memtest86+ and also under some stress.
2020-09-23 18:56:45	+SysGhost	one can most likely overvolt the 1.5 ones to 1.65 Shouldn't be much of a problem. Undervolting the ones needing 1.65 might result in some instability. Might work just fine.

2020-09-23 18:58:07	+SysGhost	As long as the airflow isn't too restricted the RAM shouldn't take that much "damage". At worst it might lose some years from the expected lifespan, which is way longer than the system most lilkely will be around in the first place

2020-09-23 18:59:23	+mpan	… with overvoltaged RAM modules. Though they are younger than the rest of the setup, as RAM was the thing I upgraded here a few times.
2020-09-23 18:59:28	+SysGhost	The tricky part will be to get the system to accept it. Usually the autodetecting bails on it and might not report the lower voltage ones. There one have to set it manually.

2020-09-23 19:08:26	+mpan	I have my father’s old PC, which even has Windows98 SE. :)
2020-09-23 19:08:46	+mpan	Such memories. On this very system I was making one of my first steps in programming.
2020-09-23 19:09:00	+SysGhost	Back onto the topic: Undervolting over overvolting? That's the question... *hmmm*
2020-09-23 19:09:00	+mpan	(though not on this hardware)
2020-09-23 19:09:14	+mpan	Undervolting is safer.
2020-09-23 19:09:24	+mpan	It will not reduce the expected lifetime.
2020-09-23 19:09:27	+SysGhost	overvolting is more stable.
2020-09-23 19:09:52	+mpan	Let me put it differently. Overvolting fails only once and in a visible way. Undervolting may fail multiple times, silently.
2020-09-23 19:09:54	+SysGhost	and the expected loss in lifespan is way outside the total lifespan anyway
2020-09-23 19:10:28	+SysGhost	actually... it fails only if the overvolting is extreme. I'd say 0.15 volts are way within the safe region.
2020-09-23 19:10:49	first-order	mpan, Wonder if you'd update it with Daemon Tools and a Gotek.
2020-09-23 19:10:50	+SysGhost	I've overclocked many RAMs with way more... even as muc has 2.85 volts on RAM that expects 1.5
2020-09-23 19:11:10	+mpan	Well, keep in mind we are talking about probability. It’s not some planned value. If the RAM would survive 96 months on average and overvoltaging reduced that by 12 months, it doesn’t mean it will not fail before 84 months.
2020-09-23 19:11:15	jescis	ok,  :o
2020-09-23 19:11:45	+mpan	It shifts the whole probability distribution, not a single point. That means: it increases chances it will die tommorow.
2020-09-23 19:11:59	+SysGhost	Yeah... well... 
2020-09-23 19:12:01	+mpan	Though yeah, it is unlikely it will burst into flames after first powering on. ;)
2020-09-23 19:12:03	+SysGhost	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2020-09-23 19:12:12	first-order	(that's what I'd do if I had 9x-era hardware within reach right now, forgo the ODD and actual floppy drive for Daemon Tools and a Gotek)
2020-09-23 19:12:31	+mpan	And yes, I am running 1.85V modules at 2.30V.
2020-09-23 19:12:45	+mpan	first-order: DaemonTools was a must-have piece of software on Windows. :D
2020-09-23 19:12:53	+mpan	(and then I discovered Linux)
2020-09-23 19:13:09	+mpan	DaemonTools solve problems that do not exist in good OS. ;)
2020-09-23 19:13:29	+SysGhost	Indeed. Or have the hysical 72x speed drive destroy itself from within as one plays the "Must have the CD in while playing" games.
2020-09-23 19:13:42	+mpan	Yep
2020-09-23 19:13:55	first-order	Although they may have been good OSes in their day and virtual ODDs weren't really a thing while they were relevant.
2020-09-23 19:13:56	+mpan	I always copy my audio CDs before playing them, and only play from FLACs.
2020-09-23 19:14:01	jescis	So I'll put the 1.50V in banks 3&4 and call it a day! job well done!
2020-09-23 19:14:59	+SysGhost	jescis: pretty much. and if things do get unstable. lower the bus clock a tad... or increase the voltage to the RAM... Choose your path, young padawan.
2020-09-23 19:15:02	first-order	Shit, Windows didn't even support USB mass storage officially until 2k and Me.
2020-09-23 19:15:04	+mpan	jescis: if your computer is not a 20 years old machine, it will most likely select something safe to begin with. It can communicate with RAM, it can query RAM for parameters, RAM can declare what it can handle. This will be certainly below maximum performance, but works in most cases.
2020-09-23 19:16:01	+SysGhost	first-order: even windows 98 had poor UMS support. it had special drivers for the UMS alone, or one had to "upgrade" to 98SE
2020-09-23 19:16:03	jescis	mpan: ok cool
2020-09-23 19:16:19	first-order	Me was also the first version to offer integrated file compression as an option.
2020-09-23 19:16:45	+mpan	jescis: in the worst case it will beep its buzzer at you, indicating it paniced and refuses to do anything. :P
2020-09-23 19:16:46	first-order	Kinda wondering why that wasn't a thing in 98se.
2020-09-23 19:17:08	jescis	mpan: lol
2020-09-23 19:17:21	first-order	That would've saved people a lot of hassle when it came to handling zip files.
2020-09-23 19:17:22	+mpan	first-order: actually until Vista or so it didn’t supported it properly anyway. If you had multiple partitions on any flash media, it couldn’t detect partitions other than the first.
2020-09-23 19:18:04	+SysGhost	Windows even today acts up on that at some cases.
2020-09-23 19:18:23	+mpan	first-order: my photo camera, which uses alternative firmware requiring two partitions on the SD card, has even special option to swap the partitions so Windows could read it. :P
2020-09-23 19:19:15	+mpan	jescis: the message we want to convey is: modern computers are smart and they put cushions all around you. It is very unlikely something will fail catastrophically immediately.
2020-09-23 19:19:27	+SysGhost	It's what impressed me the most when I tried linux the first time around 94'ish (Don't remember exactly). It could detect hard drives and storage medias way better than any OS I had prior to it. Even OS/2
2020-09-23 19:19:33	first-order	Kinda surprised it don't use a standard FAT32 file system like other removable mass storage does.
2020-09-23 19:20:16	first-order	Which the decision to use FAT32 on removable mass storage is for cross-platform compatibility.
2020-09-23 19:20:52	+mpan	jescis: it’s not like in the good old days of AT power connector. If you do not remember: the connector was in fact formed from two identical plugs that were going into two identical sockets. If you mixed them up, blue smoke escaped your mobo and/or PSU.
2020-09-23 19:21:01	first-order	Although Zalman caddies require a drive be formatted in NTFS to use the virtual ODD feature.
2020-09-23 19:21:30	+mpan	Well, into one socket, but taking two plugs side-by-side.
2020-09-23 19:21:39	jescis	mpan: Ok, oh and the board is a Biostar A770E3
2020-09-23 19:22:03	+SysGhost	mpan: it was meant to be keyed so one couldn't mix them around. But most PSU makers went lazy and skipped the keying features.

2020-09-23 19:22:40	+mpan	SysGhost: they were also supposed to be marked on both sockets and plugs. But yes, mot vendors skipped that on both sides.
2020-09-23 19:22:44	+mpan	Yes, I did fry one computer with it.
2020-09-23 19:23:07	jescis	mpan: and I do remember that, and they were huge mobos at that!
2020-09-23 19:23:51	+mpan	Good old times when memory banks were taking 3/4 of the mobo. In a form of separate DIP packages you had to plug into sockets.
2020-09-23 19:24:03	+mpan	No, I do not miss those times. :P

2020-09-23 19:58:23	th0rne	Is it power supply or might it be motherboard?

2020-09-27 22:20:10	clyme	has always been interesting to me how bad water quality is in some western countries. in germany and probably most of central europe you can take a sip out of every random lake or river and chances are its not much worse than most bottled water, if at all

2020-09-27 22:22:28	MrElendig	aka just natural bacteria/algea/etc
2020-09-27 22:23:00	MrElendig	scandinavia, specially northern parts, are much less troublesome, but we sometimes have some issues here too
2020-09-27 22:23:02	dagle	clyme: I think large part of Rhen has been used as a dumping area. It makes the the bad toxic stuff go away!
2020-09-27 22:23:25	clyme	in both cases most of what i have seen was crystal clear water and around where i used to live it was declared as high quality drinking water even
2020-09-27 22:23:37	miro	clyme: hah, no thanks, as an example my grandparents lived in village up the valley, nice pristine creek runs through it, they were the last house down the stream and yeah no, wouldn't drink from it

2020-10-03 15:28:16	reid_irl	Carduus: what do you mean?
2020-10-03 15:28:34	Carduus	Well, for some reason your message about "nick on IRC" got highlighted. Hmm... maybe it reacts to some keywords...

2020-10-03 15:29:17	reid_irl	Carduus: maybe your client did that
2020-10-03 15:29:31	Carduus	Oh, then it must be a local setting for a keyword "nick"
2020-10-03 15:29:38	Carduus	Thank you reid_irl , yes you are right.
2020-10-03 15:29:41	reid_irl	could be

2020-10-03 15:30:16	Carduus	Odd. Haha.
2020-10-03 15:30:33	reid_irl	prob some misconfiguration or something

2020-10-03 15:31:41	reid_irl	maybe it's set to "$nick,nick" or something
2020-10-03 15:31:42	Carduus	No, no, it will be just some additional "keyword" somewhere in the settings.

2020-10-03 17:06:22	+mpan	TBH I am not sure if it’s ok for the official bot to get political.
2020-10-03 17:06:42	th0rne	Is it being political, though?
2020-10-03 17:06:44	 *	Cirrus_Minor agrees
2020-10-03 17:06:58	+mpan	I enjoy that command elsewhere, but in this case we are talking about a bot that represents Arch.
2020-10-03 17:07:08	th0rne	Fair enough.
2020-10-03 17:07:14	+mpan	th0rne: yes. Trump supporters are also using Arch Linux.
2020-10-03 17:07:42	jonathon	Twitter bots are using Arch?
2020-10-03 17:07:44	th0rne	Yeah, but enjoying Trump tweets is not necessarily anti-Trump.
2020-10-03 17:07:50	demize	Meanwhile, I would be fine with something that is explicitly political and anti-Trump, I just don't think that that kind of text generators are it.
2020-10-03 17:08:07	demize	Because frankly, I'm fine with phrik telling all Trump supporters they're garbage people.  :)
2020-10-03 17:08:10	+mpan	th0rne: that command is making fun of Trump.

2020-10-03 17:08:43	demize	But it would have to be something that uses factual reasons, not caricatures.
2020-10-03 17:08:52	th0rne	mpan: But aren't those actual insults Trump made on purpose and posted on twitter?
2020-10-03 17:08:56	th0rne	Just redirected?
2020-10-03 17:09:13	th0rne	Or are they markov chained or something?
2020-10-03 17:09:32	+mpan	th0rne: yes. But it’s not organisation’s job to take political stance in that conflict. Unless, of course, Arch wants to do it, but currently CoC suggests otherwise.
2020-10-03 17:09:56	th0rne	No, and that's fine. I'm no longer suggesting that this be added. But...
2020-10-03 17:10:19	th0rne	... I don't think re-using Trump's insults is inherently anti-Trump?
2020-10-03 17:10:44	th0rne	Perhaps you think Trump's insults are good and clever and want to use them, too?
2020-10-03 17:11:04	+mpan	This is not what this command was intended for. I mean: to use them as clever comments.
2020-10-03 17:11:42	demize	On the other hand, the CoC is also not strictly official either.  It's sort of in a grey area.
2020-10-03 17:12:10	+mpan	I mean: *I* don’t mind. I consider Trump to be a clown. But I do not want Arch’s image to be affected by that command being present.
2020-10-03 17:12:20	demize	Something the wiki admins wrote without talking to the rest of us.  :p
2020-10-03 17:12:34	demize	Mmh.
2020-10-03 17:12:34	+mpan	demize: but to me it is clear that Arch stays neutral in such things.
2020-10-03 17:13:25	th0rne	I'm honestly not convinced that Trump would mind even if he cared.
2020-10-03 17:13:33	+mpan	And I am also not happy with non-persons becoming non-neutral.

2020-10-03 23:12:13	+mpan	Conspiracy theories have nothing to do with internet. Internet is just speeding things up. For all participants.
2020-10-03 23:13:45	+mpan	The same goes for urban legends. Now they spread within hours. When I was a kid it was taking a few days.
2020-10-03 23:14:13	miro	few days ago there was a story that one young czech singer died, posted on facebook and looked as if reported by major online news site ... it got crazy attention, he eventually had to step up and deny it
2020-10-03 23:14:20	+mpan	Fake news are also as old as recorded history can tell us, probably much older.
2020-10-03 23:14:54	+mpan	Maybe it was his own publicity stunt? :D
2020-10-03 23:15:54	miro	right, but internet makes it much easier, even possible at all at some cases
2020-10-03 23:16:14	miro	hah, well who knows nowadays
2020-10-03 23:16:28	+mpan	I truly doubt that. In my view internet only speeds up the sprad of information.

2020-10-03 23:17:13	miro	hmm ┐(ツ)┌
2020-10-03 23:17:14	+mpan	And it works for everyone. Not only misinformation, including conspiracy theories, spread faster, but they are also spotted faster and response is faster. Access to knowledge is also faster.
2020-10-03 23:17:44	+mpan	False flag operations predate internet by far! :D
2020-10-03 23:18:31	MrElendig	they were way easier before the internet
2020-10-03 23:18:48	+mpan	I recall one particular urban legend from my childhood. There is a psychiatric hospital in my hometown. The story started to spread that a mad guy has ran away from it and is murdering people.
2020-10-03 23:19:19	+mpan	Supposedly he lived under one bridge. Lemme show you the bridge, so you would appreciate ridiculousness of the claim in full.

2020-10-03 23:20:45	miro	eventually
2020-10-03 23:21:10	MrElendig	anyone remember the winter war btw?
2020-10-03 23:22:06	beest	People are no more or less prone to accepting or doubting conspiracies than they ever were, confirmation bias hasn't changed since the internet
2020-10-03 23:22:32	MrElendig	beest: but information is much more easily spread now
2020-10-03 23:22:34	+mpan	The bridge itself: <https://goo.gl/maps/9N76DDTrNaow2rXM7>. Back then it was half that width and if you peeked under it, there was no chance anyone could hide there. This is also one of the main roads in the town.

2020-10-03 23:27:49	+mpan	miro: to take that to some real scenario: when Cleopatra sprad false news about Anthony’s success in the Parthian campagain, she went so far as preparing an enormous celebrations in Alexandria. Now let’s imagine for a moment, how news would be spreading beyond Alexandria.
2020-10-03 23:30:02	+mpan	miro: we may imagine (this is not based on sources) that news about the victory were slowly going up Nile, over thousands of kilometers. Maybe months. If there would be anyone to rectify the news, they themselves would spend another weeks to months even learning the truth. Then they would need yet another months to spred the truth.
2020-10-03 23:30:20	beest	besides, even when given conflicting information people will go to great lengths to defend the indefensible when it doesn't suit their personal narrative
2020-10-03 23:30:53	+mpan	And it would even be hard to rectify stuff, because if word of mouth is being spread that way, what is really left at the end is “something something victory something something”. Which makes debunking it harder.
2020-10-03 23:31:48	miro	I meant more like niche news, thought I admit conspiracy theory like "paul is dead" is not that since beatles was super famous
2020-10-03 23:31:49	beest	yeah, the internet still has its own form of "chinese whispers" because no one bothers to follow the flow of data
2020-10-03 23:31:55	+mpan	The reason Cleopatra were able to hold such celebrations, despite the Partian campagain was a tragedy and, upon returning, they only make a tiny successful move, was that the real news about the outcome of the war would need weeks to months to reach even the interested parties.
2020-10-03 23:32:31	+mpan	And internet just speeds that up, IMO. All parts of the process.
2020-10-03 23:33:49	beest	and since all other information flows at the same rate in the 21st century, by the time that information comes to light something else has stolen relevance
2020-10-03 23:34:47	+mpan	Hitler would have an official Twotter account, if it existed in 1930s. It would be a massive propaganda tool for Goebbels. But in 1940s it would take weeks to have fully confirmed concentration camps and all the world would know about it.
2020-10-03 23:35:40	+mpan	Instead of months, very uncertain data and people risking their lives to gather evidence.
2020-10-03 23:36:22	beest	it wouldn't have mattered anyway because in the 21st century hitler would have found other methods to distract and disrupt the narrative
2020-10-03 23:36:33	+mpan	And then this information being limited to a few important figures, who can decide what to do with it.
2020-10-03 23:36:57	+mpan	Yeah, probably.
2020-10-03 23:37:06	beest	the faster flow of information also makes it easier to react

2020-10-03 23:37:16	+mpan	Yes, exactly my point.
2020-10-03 23:37:24	beest	so yeah, it all works out in the wash, mostly
2020-10-03 23:37:45	beest	there are certainly some conditions where we have an enlightened awareness because of 21st century information technology
2020-10-03 23:38:19	beest	but for the most part the wheels of sociology keep turning as they always have

2020-10-03 23:43:49	+mpan	I can’t claim I am on the same side, but he’s also exaggerating and misrepresenting my stanc to extremes. Which I could ignored, but then he uses that as an argument.
2020-10-03 23:44:46	digitalbot	it is a releif that i was not feeling that way alone about him... he is mostly why i have stayed quite since i have been unbanned because i didnt want to start an argument 
2020-10-03 23:44:57	+mpan	And while I do not agree with solutions, it’s not like I do not see some problems. Yet he sees the cause of literally anything in “thos shitty people”. Sometimes I think that if a comet hits Earth, he will also argue it was because of shitty people.

2020-10-04 00:09:18	miro	hah, well it's a risk of such profession mpan there's a signature and ... also makes one appreciate relative lack of responsibility we have as software engineers, that is unless you write software for some critical applications
2020-10-04 00:09:48	+mpan	miro: software is not magic. It uses models. You must know and understand a model you use and how it relates to reality. If she failed at that, e.g. by missing some factor, software can’t protect against that.
2020-10-04 00:09:51	+rcf	It is not that bizarre that the engineer who certified that the design was sound is blamed when it turns out to fail. 
2020-10-04 00:10:47	+mpan	miro: it may also be that she used too tight margins. Or, worse, made last minute changes and only eyed the result.
2020-10-04 00:11:16	+mpan	miro: we have relative lack of responsibility, but also even the simplest thing we do is more complex than what most engineers deal with.
2020-10-04 00:11:47	miro	mpan: sure, I'm not even blaming her for failing in whatever it was (don't know much about details tbh) just that there was a lack of control, no 2nd look by someone? etc. 
2020-10-04 00:12:44	+mpan	miro: this is where the scapegoat part comes in. Of course it was an organisational issue if a mistake by a single engineer could lead to a disaster.

2020-10-04 00:14:39	+rcf	The idea is that the engineer that approves a design is the one responsible for finding someone to double-check their work 
2020-10-04 00:16:51	Repentinus	In lots of places there are also state or council building inspectors that have to verify and approve a design.
2020-10-04 00:17:05	+mpan	As for software that models stuff and people misusing it… you are talking to a person who did half of his career in software for modelling/presenting/processing statitical models/data in quite important branches. Each time I was like “oh fuck, oh fuck… this is so easy to misuse.”
2020-10-04 00:17:54	+mpan	Unfortunately people, who worked with me or were the clients, didn’t understood that.
2020-10-04 00:18:36	+mpan	*didn’t understand.
2020-10-04 00:18:43	+rcf	Indeed, because accounting for human factors is expensive. 
2020-10-04 00:19:14	+mpan	Sometimes not even that. It may simply “look ugly.”
2020-10-04 00:20:29	+mpan	If you are selling a model (and associated software) for forecasting administrative unit population, the clients wants to have a clear line that tells him “in X years the population will be N.” They don’t want to see error bars taking the whole chart, because the error is 25% after just the first year.

2020-10-04 00:24:25	Repentinus	I don't understand any of the text, but a first-year statics course in any engineering discipline is going to cover why triangles are necessary.
2020-10-04 00:24:50	miro	mpan: yep, the first is how it was projected and built, middle how it failed, far right how it should have been ... admittedly not greatest drawings
2020-10-04 00:25:42	+mpan	Repentinus: quite many bridges do not have them, if the joints themselves are strong enough to keep the pillars straight.
2020-10-04 00:26:07	+mpan	Or if the pillars themselves can support the bridge.
2020-10-04 00:26:24	Repentinus	Yes, there are various ways to stiffen structures.
2020-10-04 00:26:25	+mpan	Just look around you. :)
2020-10-04 00:27:05	Repentinus	But if that sketch is at all representative of the kind of support used during the construction, this was not one of them.
2020-10-04 00:27:47	+mpan	Possibly.
2020-10-04 00:28:38	Repentinus	If it was just used by the paper to explain the generic principle and the actual structure was more complex, sure it might have been intended to use a different mechanism to stabilize the support.
2020-10-04 00:28:38	+mpan	It is also possible that she was extremely neglectful too.
2020-10-04 00:29:29	+mpan	Or easily yielded to pressure.
2020-10-04 00:29:36	+mpan	I mean: the engineer, not the bridge.
2020-10-04 00:29:39	Repentinus	Or overworked or inexperienced.

2020-10-04 00:31:17	+mpan	Designing things requires some degree of resistance to pressure from other people.

2020-10-04 00:35:29	Repentinus	It is also the reason why imposing criminal penalties in the absence of a wilful act or gross negligence for engineering malpractice is a bad idea as that makes it very very difficult to get an accurate understanding of the totality of circumstances leading up to a particular accident.
2020-10-04 00:36:03	+mpan	Indeed it is.

2020-10-04 04:21:59	+dp	thing is that control-tab combinations will require two hands

2020-10-04 04:24:32	+dp	I think that this swap will be good for me, home row control is supposed to be good, but putting the fn layer on bottom left means I can lean to access that layer
2020-10-04 04:24:46	+dp	that layer gives me numerals and !@#$%^& etc

2020-10-04 04:43:45	+dp	which isn't untrue
2020-10-04 04:44:32	+dp	but even when peer programming with people with 60% boards I notice the reach they have to do to get to the return key

2020-10-04 04:44:38	+dp	lol
2020-10-04 04:44:41	+dp	probably the latter tbh
2020-10-04 04:45:16	+dp	I infrequently use the arrow keys in the form of hjkl on a function layer
2020-10-04 04:45:24	beest	being ambidextrous and arthritic i've kinda trained myself to just reach for whatever's nearest

2020-10-04 05:37:39	+dp	order of the units helps with vector calculations
2020-10-04 05:38:22	+dp	since A cross B is -(B cross A)
2020-10-04 05:38:26	Repentinus	Considering torque is a vector product of the position vector and applied force, the order does matter.

2020-10-04 05:39:42	+dp	But once you start doing silleh vector stuff it makes it all negative if they're in the wrong order heh

2020-10-04 12:24:11	+mpan	Oh, interesting.
2020-10-04 12:24:30	miro	... and as "Unbrako" key or wrench in Scandinavia (originally a Pennsylvania company established in 1911, in 2008 acquired by Deepak Fasteners Limited).[2] In Italy, it is known as brugola, for the company Officine Egidio Brugola (established 1926)
2020-10-04 12:24:33	+mpan	Indeed, Wikipedia refers to “INBUS” too. Seems like a genericized trademark.
2020-10-04 12:24:41	miro	lol how many names does it have
2020-10-04 12:25:38	miro	ye I think most people pronounce iMbus here
2020-10-04 12:25:40	+mpan	Carduus: please post the description of the problem, including the explanation of what is *exactly* happening (error messages etc.), on #archlinux.
2020-10-04 12:26:21	+mpan	(that is under the assumption that the issue is with Arch Linux; note: Manjaro and other derivatives, as well as Arch Linux ARM and Arch Linux 32, are not Arch)

2020-10-04 12:27:19	Reventlov	speaking of which, I always wonder why Arch didn't try to "maintain" different building architectures as "mainline arch"

2020-10-04 12:29:05	+mpan	I understand it as: those people have their own support channels. And their distros have different packages sets, different configurations, different versions of stuff, may operate differently.
2020-10-04 12:29:24	Reventlov	yeah, yeah, but I mean in the past i686 was supported by the real archlinux
2020-10-04 12:29:31	Reventlov	and then it was dropped

2020-10-04 12:29:55	+mpan	But by different people.
2020-10-04 12:30:00	+mpan	(at least theoretically)
2020-10-04 12:30:40	Carduus	It is on Arch, but I happened to find a forum devoted to the problematics. I will do more research on the problem first, not to ask again for something that's out there somewhere, haha. However, thank you mpan !
2020-10-04 12:30:51	+mpan	I see it the same way as ##java@Freenode is treating questons about Android even harsher than Manjaro mentions are treated on Arch channels.
2020-10-04 12:32:10	+mpan	Carduus: my blind+educated guess is that this is the paragraph you need: <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg#Signature_checking>. But it would be better to form good questions, even before searching for the answers on your own.

2020-10-04 13:41:25	+mpan	Carduus: while knowing and using GnuPG and OpenPGP in general is useful, to use `makepkg` you do not to master either of those. For `makepkg` all you need is understanding: 1) what is the purpose of digital signatures; 2) superficially how it is being used; 3) how to securely import keys.
2020-10-04 13:41:40	+mpan	*you do not need to master either of those
2020-10-04 13:43:18	+mpan	Reading the whole GnuPG manual is kinda pointless and I doubt there are many people who ever did that. Including many GnuPG devs/contributors. ;)
2020-10-04 13:44:52	Carduus	"Abstraction"? Thank you, sure. I do not want to "master" them, only to start to learn about them. When I reach a point where it will be "pointless" it should be obvious. I rather wanted to acquire a base upon which I can build on encounter with other information. Knowing how to use it, does not serve such a purpose.

2020-10-04 13:51:27	+mpan	Carduus: let’s start with an example. Alice wants to send a message to Bob. But she wants to be sure that Bob receives exactly the same message as she sent. Even if there is Mallory around, who wishes to modify it.
2020-10-04 13:51:56	Carduus	Yes, this story or a simillar one is everywhere. Hahaha.
2020-10-04 13:53:01	+mpan	Carduus: so she *ditially signs* that message and then Bob is able to verify the signature. This gives him certainity that the message is exactly the same and Mallory hasn’t modified it. Of course Mallory may try that, but unless he is unimaginably powerful, any his modification will be detected by Bob.

2020-10-04 13:54:02	+mpan	Carduus: in your case the message is the signed source code. Using the signature (in .asc or .sig file) you may verify that what you received is exactly what the author of the source has provided.
2020-10-04 13:54:45	+mpan	Carduus: to do that you need a piece of information: their public key. As long as you are sure that the key really belongs to them, there is no sane way to do anything to the signed files.

2020-10-04 13:56:34	+mpan	Carduus: so, if you are Bob, the only thing you need is the public key of Alice (if she is the author of the file). Those can be obtained in many ways. Two most popular ones is either acquiring them from the author themselves (e.g. from their website, some associated website, personally, in email…) or — which is much more convenient — from places where maaaaany people publish their keys: 
2020-10-04 13:56:40	+mpan	keyservers.
2020-10-04 13:57:06	+mpan	Carduus: what `makepkg` was complaining about is that probably that you didn’t have the key, so it could not verify the sources are in fact from Alice.
2020-10-04 13:57:34	Carduus	Neither of the signature files were present (?).

2020-10-04 13:57:57	+mpan	Carduus: the signature files must have been present (.sig or .asc), because otherwise `makepkg` would not try to verify signatures (as there would be no signatures).
2020-10-04 13:58:06	+mpan	Carduus: but it had no keys to perform the verification.
2020-10-04 13:58:35	Carduus	Hmm... The AUR package is palemoon. Take a look, I've tried to find the files, could not.
2020-10-04 13:58:49	 *	mpan looks…
2020-10-04 13:59:24	Carduus	The link you posted to the ArchWiki said something about missing signature files, that you can import the signatures in another way... I did not follow further since I miss the base knowledge.
2020-10-04 14:00:38	Carduus	(They have the signature file for the tarball, tough.)
2020-10-04 14:02:16	Carduus	Ah, sorry, no, the ArchWiki says about missing public key, as you described the possibility of acquiring it through the keyserver.
2020-10-04 14:03:55	Carduus	Haha. Something tells me that you will find the signature files mpan , only I have overlooked them somewhere.
2020-10-04 14:07:32	+mpan	Carduus: indeed. In this case the git repo itself has signed commits. The signatures are, in this case, stored in the git repo itself. Not as a separate .sig/.asc file.

2020-10-04 14:09:15	+mpan	Likely with all the red stuff poured all over your terminal, because the keys can’t be found.
2020-10-04 14:11:22	Carduus	Thank you once again mpan ! This is why I want to learn more about the whole mechanism. Seemingly the keys/signatures can be in different places for different reasons. By understanding why, I could follow the track to them if missing, just like you. 
2020-10-04 14:12:07	+mpan	Yes, but this is a very git-specific thing. If the sources were separate files, those would be .asc/.sig files. :)

So every change must come by little steps, like as if you were to climb a steep hill. Then you must do a change of identity, i.e. establish your priorities and rules to which you will default without being conscious about it.

2020-10-17 23:33:50	first-order	I would think their enterprise drives would've favored SAS over SATA for the 2.5" models.
