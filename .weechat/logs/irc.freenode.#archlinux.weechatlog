2020-08-20 01:23:51	alschaapman	I was trying to resize my PV just now but I had a logical volume that was past the boundary I was trying to set. Fortunately I happened to remember that it was the swap volume which was safe to remove and recreate after the resize, because I couldn't remember how to get this information
2020-08-20 01:23:53	mpan	Considering that `pacdiff` finds no pacnews on my system, I assume this is not the first case.
2020-08-20 01:24:28	alschaapman	Also generally I feel like LVM provides some utility to reorganize the extents to the beginning of the PV but I can't remember how to do that either
2020-08-20 01:24:30	eschwartz	h4rd3n3D: MODULES=() in mkinitcpio.conf refers to kernel modules, i.e. /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/.../luks2.ko -- except there is no such module, and this is only relevant to grub, which is before the initcpio, so... just grub-install --modules=luks2

2020-08-20 20:22:18	SysGhost	Should have some backup bios then. if that doesn't fire up either, you have some invalid/corrupt cmos/nvram setting. pull the clock battery, *and* use the "clear cmos" jumper. While the jumper is in the clear position, power on the computer (while battery is out.) Then yank the power plug. After that let the computer sit for a minute to be sure any residual charges bleed out. Restore jumper and battery and try again

2020-08-20 20:31:58	NetSysFire	so i doubt its a hw failure
2020-08-20 20:32:06	SysGhost	NetSysFire: if the firmware did work initially, a properly cleared cmos should bring it back to that initial state.

2020-08-20 20:32:22	SysGhost	otherwise it's a hardware fault or the cmos wasn't cleared
2020-08-20 20:32:50	NetSysFire	when the board still worked we verified that the cmos can be cleared with that jumper

2020-08-20 20:35:43	SysGhost	only thing left I can think of is the nvram part. it won't erase even with a battery pulled. That needs to be erased too. And it can only be erased by one of two methods: System need to be powered on with a "clear cmos" or in some cases "clear nvram" jumper/switch. The other method is to locate the nvram chip (usually a 8-pin serial flash chip) and replace it with a cleared one. (Requires soldering in some cases)

2020-08-20 20:44:50	NetSysFire	yep, i requested a refund
2020-08-20 20:45:02	SysGhost	NetSysFire: The thing is that the firware itself should work it it has worked prior. firmware itself can't suddenly stop working. if both the cmos memory *and* the nvram area are properly erased, the firmware loads factory defaults. The only thing that could cause it tofail even that is a hardware fault
2020-08-20 20:45:30	NetSysFire	well the board is kinda cheap, so i wouldnt be surprised
2020-08-20 20:45:51	sangy	SysGhost: which I guess includes "can't clear things to factory default properly and leaves stuff in an inconsistent state"
2020-08-20 20:46:23	Foxboron	welp
2020-08-20 20:46:24	SysGhost	only thing I can suspect is that either the cmos or the nvram hasn't been fully erased. Something there hols it back with a faulty setting.

I'm trying to use the archlinux Live USB to install another system that needs to compile packages, but the problem is that, dd'ing archlinux into my USB uses only the space it of course needs, some MB, but I want to use the whole space since I need all the space available for compiling, 4GB.
2020-08-20 22:01:39	iamjohn	Yea, there is an ip address

2020-08-20 22:53:23	SysGhost	lts = Long Term Support (It's a kernel version stuck at a particular version for an extended period of time.)

2020-08-20 22:57:09	iamjohn	I have an ip, the only interface but loopback it is
2020-08-20 22:57:11	SysGhost	Only thing would be that you didn't reboot after upgrading the kernel, or that the boot partition wasn't mounted when the kernel was updated. Also could be the wifi adapter uses a third party driver, and not the kernel included ones. Prehaps those needs recompiling. Hard t o way without details.

2020-08-20 23:01:00	SysGhost	in short: it can ping your iphone just fine, but the iphone doesn't allow your computer to use the connection.
2020-08-20 23:01:04	iamjohn	I don't think so. it works on windows
2020-08-20 23:02:19	NetSysFire	this doesnt make sense or its some proprietary poorly documented apple thing
2020-08-20 23:02:22	SysGhost	That's the thing with Apple. Official drivers, iTunes and whatnot makes it work nice. Linux is a different as that isn't officially supported by apple. You need to somehow tell the iphone to allow the connection through. (it's currently being blocked as it sees the computer/linux as "unsecure" or "Not authorized")

2020-08-20 23:34:41	castleguard	I'm looking for (xy) either a tui for gzip, or a gzip extension for vifm or mc... I'm just looking to backup my dotfiles and a few other files, zip them, and email them to myself. 
2020-08-20 23:34:45	castleguard	Any suggestions?
2020-08-20 23:35:03	castleguard	Now that I've put some time into filling out task warrior stuff I'm paranoid about losing it.
2020-08-20 23:35:32	NetSysFire	there are some nice backup solutions out there

2020-08-20 23:36:55	castleguard	bear in mind that my use case is very small
2020-08-20 23:37:13	castleguard	I don't currently require encryption either.
2020-08-20 23:37:22	castleguard	or at least I'm not committed to using it.

2020-08-20 23:37:31	NetSysFire	i recommend to backup not only your taskwarrior stuff
2020-08-20 23:37:33	castleguard	*I'll check out borg
2020-08-20 23:37:35	castleguard	agreed
2020-08-20 23:37:45	NetSysFire	i am sure it will hurt to lose e.g your documents
2020-08-20 23:37:47	eigenfire	No reason not to encrypt your shit.
2020-08-20 23:38:02	castleguard	eigenfire: I know - just that top priority is to backup, first.
2020-08-20 23:38:09	eigenfire	Do both in the same step.
2020-08-20 23:38:18	eigenfire	Don't do "first, second." Do both at the same time.

2020-08-20 23:39:30	NetSysFire	i also recommend using encryption because the email provider you use can see all of your stuff, but if you dont want to its okay. just be aware of the risk
2020-08-20 23:39:34	SysGhost	I tried that...but... no one wanted to mirror my shit. =C

2020-08-20 23:48:05	rememberYou	hi friends. Beginner question, I'm using a laptop with 1To SSD with 8.0G RAM. Until today, I used a 8.0G swap file but I have read that I ZRAM or Zwap could be a solution to improve the performance of my system. Could you tell me which one I should prefer for my case and why? It would help me for my next Arch Linux installation
2020-08-20 23:48:41	rememberYou	note: I rarely go on the swap space
2020-08-20 23:49:01	eigenfire	rememberYou: Rewind. What performance problems are you experiencing?
2020-08-20 23:49:02	rememberYou	oh and my apologies, I have 16G RAM and not 8G )

2020-08-20 23:50:03	eigenfire	And did you verify that that had anything to do with memory or swap usage?
2020-08-20 23:50:22	rememberYou	after a fresh Arch Linux reinstallation, things working well but I was like, should I use ZRAM or Zswap to limite I/O disk access or something like that

2020-08-20 23:51:12	rememberYou	yeah, after I did a htop, I could see that the 16Go RAM was almost full and the swap was used. Probably an issue with qutebrowser or GNU Emacs I couldn't tell to be honest

2020-08-20 23:52:14	rememberYou	thanks, I will sleep smarter.
2020-08-20 23:52:15	eigenfire	rememberYou: neither of those are going to solve your problem either. If you're experiencing freezing, figure out why its freezing.
2020-08-20 23:52:29	eigenfire	And given that you're on an SSD, I/O isn't your issue either.
2020-08-20 23:52:29	SysGhost	If there's no applications that need a crazy amount of RAM still uses a crazy amount of RAM that application has serious memory leak issues. swap or zram won't fix any of that whatsoever.

2020-08-21 00:06:12	SysGhost	rememberYou:  zram can be useful when one uses application that utilize swap space as scratch or temporary "stoveaway". (GIMP as an example). Instead of the kernel using slow hard disk swap for temporary data storage, it stuffs the data into a z-compressed portion in the RAM instead. faster that way. A memory run-out situation as you describe it, have no benefits of this at all. It can even hurt the system further. That is a problem you 
2020-08-21 00:06:13	SysGhost	should solve directly. No applications should cause a memory runout situation like that. (unless you're trying to run enormously large programs/data on a memory-deprived system)

2020-08-21 14:13:16	eigenfire	SELinux is a mandatory access control framework. That the Gentoo wiki describes it as RBAC is their error.
2020-08-21 14:14:29	r3boot	SELinux can be configured as RBAC
2020-08-21 14:15:32	eigenfire	Same with AppArmor.
2020-08-21 14:15:42	r3boot	and actually, RBAC is a superset of MAC, which is way beyond DAC
2020-08-21 14:16:19	iola	Anyways, Foxboron had what I was thinking of. It can use its its own RDBMS to communicate with/store user/group data.

2020-08-21 14:20:07	grawity	nor does LDAP immediately mean ADS
2020-08-21 14:20:08	eigenfire	I don't see the issue with LDAP, frankly.
2020-08-21 14:20:12	grawity	that's not at all what I meant, no
2020-08-21 14:21:02	grawity	unix style permissions (assuming you mean file permissions) are something that seems completely unrelated to what LDAP *or* keycloak *or* ADFS do
2020-08-21 14:21:27	eigenfire	LDAP is a standard technology.
2020-08-21 14:21:30	r3boot	iola: just run kerberos+openldap+sssd (or, shudder, pam/nss-ldap), and you've got the similar techniques implemented as what AD does; Next, bolt on something like keycloak, and you have an adfs (saml) solution
2020-08-21 14:21:33	grawity	speaking of ADFS, that's more or less just the same SAML2 that Keycloak also implements

2020-08-21 14:48:46	iola	im ok with my rd.luks config as of right now. Althought I do want to avoid the race condition between unlocking my swap partition or my root. With that said, this safeboot dev looks pretty cool. But isnt there already a way to load luks keys into a tpm 2.0 module?
2020-08-21 14:49:00	grawity	race condition?
2020-08-21 14:49:40	iola	Sometimes my machine asks for my swap partition backup password before it asks for my root partition. sometimes it just asks for my root partition and unlocks my swap partition automatically (intended). 
2020-08-21 14:49:50	iola	I think it might be the ordering of my kernel params...

2020-08-21 15:53:32	krumelmonster	concering this statically linking software I'm trying to package properly, there's another issue: Although the software itself has been released, libraries it uses (they're from the same developer) haven't been officially released but the build instructions say you should clone the git repositories. Does this make it impossible to get it into community?

I tried executing `sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create` manually, and the changes don't get applied. Anyone has any clu

This time:  from a clean SSD and from a clean Arch LUKS2 encrypted /, /boot and swap install, I appended `--modules=luks2` to 'grub-install', per your suggestion.

Then, despite Namarrgon telling me that kernel modules and grub modules are two independent things, I tried to add luks2 to MODULES in mkinitcpio.conf and rebuild my initramfs.  That fails with ERROR:  module not found:  `luks2'.  You get the same fail with `luks' or `luks 2` in MODULES.  With an empty MODULES statement, I reverted to grub-install and appended

Looking at the file date of systemd-login.pacnew it was delivered nine days ago. And with the update from yesterday they removed the "pam_tally.so" which was deconfigerd in "system-login.pacnew". So my advice: Allways process pacnew files immediately. Thanks all for your help.

However, for encrypted /boot to work, / *must* be encrypted with `--type= luks 1`.  We are trying to see if it is possible for grub to unlock a luks2 encrypted /boot

2020-08-21 22:02:36	_h4rd3n3D_	SysGhost:  how, this has failed in the past using grub-git.  Why would it work now, because the luks2 module is 'new'?  and BTW:  is --module= or --modules= the correct syntax?
2020-08-21 22:02:39	MrElendig	also, get yourself a usb->ethernet adapter
2020-08-21 22:02:54	MrElendig	they are cheap and really useful to keep in your toolkit

2020-08-23 12:40:52	chupachup	Hello guys!Is it fundamentally correct to add BlackArch repositories to Manjaro?I believe it is not. But also I doubt my believes knowing that I'm still a beginner. A lot of linux users told me that it is alright and that it should work. But I think doing so will break the installation ultimately. Because BlackArch repo has packages intended for

Am I right on this?I know this question is in no way related to Arch because neither BlackArch nor Manjaro is arch. Still, I believe this is the best place to ask this question and get a concrete answer.

2020-08-23 13:05:25	Zauberfisch	tonitch: sounds like a DNS server configuration problem
2020-08-23 13:06:14	Zauberfisch	many from the shelf firewall+dns+dhcp+router boxes are configured to automatically resolve the dhcp hostname as a local domain name
2020-08-23 13:06:22	Zauberfisch	so in simple terms what happens:
2020-08-23 13:06:50	Zauberfisch	your client pc connects to the network, it asks the dhcp server for an ip and while doing so, it tells the dhcp server it's name (hostname)
2020-08-23 13:07:04	tonitch	isn't it arp tho ? 
2020-08-23 13:07:10	Zauberfisch	the dhcp server then registers that hostname as a domain to be resolved by the dns server
2020-08-23 13:07:23	tonitch	that manage that I mean
2020-08-23 13:07:23	Zauberfisch	so the dhcp server and dns server on the ISPs box need to talk to each other

2020-08-23 13:20:03	Zauberfisch	but, I see an alternative here. you can register manual assignments here if you are ok with using static IPs

2020-08-23 13:23:13	tonitch	yhea and that's what I thoug arp was used for x)
2020-08-23 13:23:26	Zauberfisch	ARP is a level below that
2020-08-23 13:23:38	tonitch	like I saw some explanation on the mitm attack on the net and then I read a lot aout arp :p
2020-08-23 13:23:55	tonitch	soo I though that this was the thing I was looking for but again I'm lost x)
2020-08-23 13:24:03	Zauberfisch	so, in the config of the DHCP server (which is running on your modem),  you can create a list and tell the DHCP server to always give a certain IP to a certain mac address
2020-08-23 13:24:18	tonitch	yep, i'll go for that
2020-08-23 13:24:25	Zauberfisch	that's what orange calls "Assign a fixed IP address"
2020-08-23 13:24:30	tonitch	is there any counterpart tho ?
2020-08-23 13:24:44	Zauberfisch	so you can click add here, enter the mac address of your PC, and a IP that you want the PC to have
2020-08-23 13:24:56	Zauberfisch	and then, everytime your PC connects, it will always get the same IP from the DHCP server
2020-08-23 13:25:04	Zauberfisch	so you don't have to change anything on your PC
2020-08-23 13:25:08	Zauberfisch	it's all done by the modem

2020-08-23 19:55:30	Renf	Anyway. My issue is Steam wasn't dedtecting my generic xbox 360 controller, so I did as the wiki page for Joypad says and installed xboxdrv and used mimic-xpad=true, so then it did but not all buttons worked... So I messed with some config files and that fixed the rest of the mapping for every other program except Steam... But now Steam detects the controller but no buttons work
2020-08-23 19:55:33	Zauberfisch	bostongeek36: iscsi is not scis
2020-08-23 19:55:38	scgtrp	They're 5.25in floppy disks, if that matters.
2020-08-23 19:55:40	Zauberfisch	bostongeek36: iscsi is an industry standard
2020-08-23 19:55:52	Zauberfisch	that is very much in use everywhere today

2020-08-23 19:56:55	Renf	So, now even resetting all the config for xboxdrv and even reinstalling xboxdrv doesn't work and Steam won't detect any contrtoller button presses
2020-08-23 19:57:00	dreisner	...because it's related to what it actually is?

2020-08-23 20:35:52	dreisner	because AccuracySec is for coalescing timers and minmizing wakeups
2020-08-23 20:36:03	dviola	interesting
2020-08-23 20:36:22	dreisner	typical user behavior of cron is to want to run a bunch of things at some point overnight. you don't care exactly when they run, but might not want them running all at once.
2020-08-23 20:36:34	dreisner	RandomizedDelaySec accomplishes this at the cost of *more* wakeups.
2020-08-23 20:37:09	dreisner	but that's fine. minimizing wakeups isn't the typical use case.

2020-08-23 20:48:52	dreisner	it *does* mean that the timer might not elapse right at 8:00, but the point is that it'll be coalesced with any nearby timer to reduce the number of wakeups. so, unless you have another timer firing between 7:59 and 8:01, it's likely to have little to no effect.

2020-08-25 19:12:25	raster	r3boot: in fact .. this would be good for someone wrapping arch with a friendlier instaler/setup just to install a minimal arch rescue os on the same system/media/drive as the host - like just set aside 1gb partition for just that and ensure its always available from grub etc. so in case you lose your rescue thumbdrive... it's always there. provide enough cmdline tools to do a full rescue and maybe provide an automated rescue

I was hoping it might work in VirtualBox, since theoretically, it should have direct hardware access, but it's not working. Maybe with kvm?
2020-08-26 15:46:42	grawity	well the whole point of a VM is that it *doesn't* have direct hardware access (except maybe for things like HDDs as mentioned above or USB passthrough)

2020-08-27 12:14:22	budRich	hello. i got a new computer yesterday, and installed arch onit. i see some stuff has changed since last time i did this, and i cant get wifi working. i got it working on the live-cd with iwctl, and i have iwd, systemd-networkd/resolved started and enabled. I was wondering, are there any way to see how these things are configured on the installation ISO?
2020-08-27 12:14:57	budRich	i have always just used netctl and wifi-menu in the past, but i want to get with the times.

2020-08-27 12:17:43	roxlu	normally I use dhcpcd to automatically configure my network. but currently my network is down so I'm trying to setup an quick fix using a traver router. the travel router is connected to my phone and it's connected via a wire to the switch of my pc
2020-08-27 12:18:31	roxlu	i'm "online" .. i can ping ip addresses but dns doesn't work. probably becuase something goes wrong the dhcp leases as my dsl modem normally provides the dhcp

2020-08-27 13:00:27	phanter	My laptop is an arch install (lvm on luks). On boot it asks my password, and after providing it the boot continues. Good. After that _suddenly_ linux does not accept my passwords anymore.

Somehow Windows and macOS seems to handle it well but on Arch if anything has to be swapped, it means my system is doomed to almost frozen state and I might as well plug out the power cable. I am using fast nvme drive for swap, so it is not the disk that is issue. Has anyone solved this?

2020-08-27 15:40:25	Janhouse	On servers this is usually not that bad but for desktop it's just a terrible nightmare.
2020-08-27 15:40:32	cdown	to be clear, there's no real way to measure the usage in a typical desktop scenario. desktop scenarios often heavily rely on page cache activity, so considering it "free" is a fool's errand
2020-08-27 15:40:41	cdown	so you can't assume cache is free.

2020-08-27 17:28:24	jbg	it's arch linux on both ends of the stream
2020-08-27 17:28:33	jelle	nice
2020-08-27 17:28:39	jbg	doesn't probably make sense to use google's proprietary protocol to stream between two linux boxes
2020-08-27 17:28:43	jelle	kinda wonder if kodi has something
2020-08-27 17:28:46	tpr	vlc can do something like that, no?
2020-08-27 17:28:52	fogobogo	jbg: well, chromecast is propietary. thats wehre your troubles start
2020-08-27 17:28:52	demonicmaniac1	the only alternative if the media isnt' centralized i can think of is just to scp the files to the tv laptop and have a simple inotify running on the tv laptop that watches the folder you scp to and plays those back automatically then
2020-08-27 17:29:01	jbg	yes, but i'm not asking for chromecast
2020-08-27 17:29:03	Tom^	demonicmaniac1: samba share. :p
2020-08-27 17:29:12	jbg	i'm asking for the way to do the equivalent thing between two linux boxes

2020-08-27 17:32:30	tpr	most televisions support dlna nowadays, it all depends on what sort of features you want (e.g., there's no direct support for separate subtitles in the protocol)
2020-08-27 17:32:56	tpr	but I think vlc server is supposed to do also something like this, no? if you run it on the backend and then simply vlc on your client device
2020-08-27 17:33:10	jbg	tpr: yeah, i stayed in a place with a nice LG TV and was able to push video to it from my laptop, but never did get subs to work
2020-08-27 17:33:21	jbg	tpr: interesting, i will look at whether VLC could work too

2020-08-27 17:33:57	tpr	jbg: some dlna server implementations have re-encoding option where they burn the subs to the video stream, and some manufacturers (I think samsung?) has some proprietary support for separate sub files
2020-08-27 17:33:58	jbg	rather than for pretending to be a TV

2020-08-27 17:34:42	tpr	I cannot recall if it can do transcoding with subs tho

2020-08-27 17:40:36	jbg	i have seen a few cases where things were mapped wrong, like "subwoofer" was actually the headphone jack

2020-09-01 12:32:43	matzy_	quick question. I messed up a wm I was trying (stumpwm), and every single command is prefix by a primary key binding. So every command beings with control+t by default. I was trying to change this key and messed up in the config file. Not realizing I rebooted, and now can do nothing. Is there anything I can do on the arch side (I was thinking in

2020-09-02 15:25:21	lilltiger	also check if your PSU is good enought to power the GPU to begin with
2020-09-02 15:25:37	JangXa	As a hardware noob. The system is running for like 4 years now. No major changes in hardware and the problems started like two weeks ago (no hardware change)
2020-09-02 15:25:46	JangXa	Is it possible to degrade to that behaviour?
2020-09-02 15:25:51	lilltiger	yes
2020-09-02 15:26:03	lilltiger	it could also be the cooling for the GPU

2020-09-02 15:26:33	JangXa	That was my first instinct. Cleaned out the thing good. Started manual fan control to full. IT crashed at 68 degrees
2020-09-02 15:26:37	JangXa	several times
2020-09-02 15:26:42	JangXa	So I ruled overheating out

2020-09-02 15:26:57	JangXa	And yes the system is pretty much the same as it was build 4 years ago
2020-09-02 15:27:07	lilltiger	can still be overheating
2020-09-02 15:27:09	JangXa	I added some ram and a harddrive 2 years in
2020-09-02 15:27:28	lilltiger	as the GPU has several chipset and the termal connection for them might be bad
2020-09-02 15:27:37	JangXa	Hmm I see
2020-09-02 15:28:09	JangXa	Im fairly sure that I cant do much software wise. For test purposes I booted into windows and tried it out there same symptoms

2020-09-02 15:31:43	NetSysFire	when your device crashes and the journal does not get synced to disk, its not lost

2020-09-02 15:33:00	lilltiger	JangXa: btw have you tried to update the system, like checking if there is a new driver for the GPU, could be a driver bug as well

Or for example some utilities like wget or curl on Linux, if they find ipv6 they try to use that. And I have been banging my head why they don't work. Turns out I had to specify curl -4, to force it to use ipv4 because the target server only supported that.

And even if you deal with the firewall issue on ipv6, an other issue is still privacy. It's easier to track since every device has its own unique ip, instead of being hidden behind a nat gateway.

2020-09-03 22:14:18	n00b101	They are mixing random things + my Mac?
2020-09-03 22:14:23	NetSysFire	void09: you said it worked before but this is a new PC, so maybe your hardware differs. or even your firmware versions
2020-09-03 22:14:25	n00b101	For randomness I believe
2020-09-03 22:15:17	NetSysFire	this isnt really an arch related question
2020-09-03 22:15:25	void09	NetSysFire: it's the same card I used before that worked.. new pc (motherboard). this is the only thing that changed, except more uptodate arch I guess
2020-09-03 22:15:53	teraflops	try a different kernel
2020-09-03 22:15:53	void09	haven't used it in a year.. Yeah it's not directly related to arch I guess, but wanted to get a clue on how to debug this
2020-09-03 22:15:55	NetSysFire	void09: i wonder if the lts kernel works
2020-09-03 22:16:10	teraflops	↑

2020-09-03 22:16:36	NetSysFire	void09: the "not really an arch related question" was meant for n00b101
2020-09-03 22:16:54	NetSysFire	and the lts kernel is 5.4 already

2020-09-04 12:01:38	kevr	there's a program called autorandr that saves xrandr profiles and sets them

2020-09-04 12:03:32	th0rne	I thought about putting it in .xprofile, but then the monitor blacks out for like two seconds when you do this, so I guess it would be preferable that it's set before starting x.
2020-09-04 12:03:57	th0rne	Not sure if that makes sense.
2020-09-04 12:04:02	kevr	do you use xinit or a dm?

2020-09-04 12:05:18	kevr	it doesnt
2020-09-04 12:05:36	kevr	xinitrc is run inside of an X session
2020-09-04 12:05:40	th0rne	How many Hz do I get when I'm typing in my username?
2020-09-04 12:05:49	kevr	i dunno
2020-09-04 12:05:52	kevr	but that uses a framebuffer
2020-09-04 12:06:10	th0rne	Can I run framebuffer at 144 Hz?
2020-09-04 12:06:18	kevr	i don't know.

2020-09-04 12:08:12	kevr	then it'll just set it to that as x starts
2020-09-04 12:08:37	th0rne	Would that black out for less time or the same?
2020-09-04 12:08:46	th0rne	Than if I set it in xinitrc?

2020-09-04 12:11:30	kerframil	my guess would be because no explicit refresh rate were specified and it was discovered by way of EDID data.

2020-09-04 12:12:51	kevr	usually they're kernel parameters

2020-09-07 14:05:31	Celmor[m]	I just assumed as I likely went out of memory (since I was saving stuff to tmpfs and wasn't limited it at the time) and since everything become unresponsive or slow, even num-lock led wasn't reaction for a while
2020-09-07 14:05:55	Celmor[m]	When I did get an ssh connection again I checked free memory and was barely having any

2020-09-07 14:09:00	Celmor[m]	@DarwinSurvivor don't hang yourself up on why I should run into OOM, I did several days ago several times.
2020-09-07 14:09:41	Celmor[m]	I actually increased the tmpfs size too, to about 38G to fit the size of my working data (of 64G RAM) 
2020-09-07 14:11:09	Celmor[m]	Point is that I was now only running low of memory but didn't actually run out apparently as no oom killer was invoked (according to journal). After the system reacted again to my ssh client and I've checked htop I only saw compton pinning a thread at 100%

2020-09-07 14:21:03	DarwinSurvivor	I've worked in a few big data industries and one of the tricks we used was to create a separate tmpfs for compute jobs so that if the program gets out of hand, /tmp doesn't fill up and crash stuff (trust me, a full /tmp WILL crash stuff)

2020-09-07 17:24:40	grawity	the existing / cannot be unmounted until everything else underneath it is unmounted and all files closed, so at best it can just start giving you read errors
2020-09-07 17:25:03	grawity	so RAM filesystems like /run, or other physical disks at /mnt/whatever, will remain
2020-09-07 17:25:10	eschwartz	so in theory you could ask the bsdtar developers to use multithreading somehow in the C API it uses. If one exists
2020-09-07 17:25:30	VinnySauce	@grawity, @spiri what about running off a live USB for a bit and mounting your boot drive to that?
2020-09-07 17:25:50	VinnySauce	that way, if it disconnects, the host journald on the Live USB should capture the SATA errors
2020-09-07 17:26:07	grawity	sure, but those come from dmesg anyway, so you might as well follow dmesg directly
2020-09-07 17:26:17	VinnySauce	aye
2020-09-07 17:26:32	VinnySauce	but either way you still have a functioning system if/when the drive disconnects
2020-09-07 17:26:41	eschwartz	dunno if liblzma has such functionality, but if it does, you're not bound to what /usr/bin/xz supports

2020-09-07 17:29:45	VinnySauce	so the task is - see what the output of dmesg is after your system drive has disconnected, right?

2020-09-07 17:31:07	grawity	VinnySauce: yeah you can just keep dmesg -w writing to a file (e.g. USB flash drive... but maybe enable alt+sysrq for emergency sync), or dmesg -wL on screen
2020-09-07 17:31:42	VinnySauce	yeah, as long as the file writes and the USB drive is unmounted cleanly, you'd have a persistent log
2020-09-07 17:33:14	spiri	i could do the setup for this, but however i don't know if i fully understand the log
2020-09-07 17:33:26	spiri	or at least finding the right lines
2020-09-07 17:33:39	VinnySauce	we can cross that bridge
2020-09-07 17:33:44	VinnySauce	when you have the log :)

2020-09-07 17:36:06	VinnySauce	assuming you didn't have any SATA problems before setting up the VM?
2020-09-07 17:36:18	spiri	no
2020-09-07 17:36:27	spiri	but now with EFI it crashed for the first time

2020-09-07 17:38:33	grawity	or actually
2020-09-07 17:38:54	grawity	maybe you just need to name the icon file *after* the mine type

2020-09-08 13:08:28	kek_	hi, so I reinstalled my arch. Installed networkmanager and nm-applet and if I try to connect to my universities eduroam it starts connecting and disconnecting instantly in a loop. After gooling and reading about this problem I figured out that if I set ipv6 from"automatic" to "automatic dhcp" it works fine. I'm still wondering why this problem happens. dmesg gives me https://bpa.st/raw/J7CQ before nm-applet I checked out wpa_gui didn't do much with it 
2020-09-08 13:08:28	kek_	though. My running services are https://bpa.st/raw/C3AA also mz hosts file https://bpa.st/raw/4H2A - now how can I inverstigate this further and can anyone point me in a direction that might help me solve this?

2020-09-08 13:33:00	amirthehossein	that's not my answer, it querys for unused pkgs, for example , if I install lftp now, it's not required by any other pkgs ( you can see it by this command : pacman -Qi lftp ) 
2020-09-08 13:33:08	kek_1	Namarrgon, I think I installed it yesterday. I was checking out other network tools like wpa_supplicant with wpa_gui and iirc I kept getting errors like "can't resolve hostname" etc. and after googling the problem I think I neded up with getting dhcpcd which solved it. Disabling it seems to solve my problem. Didn't think that might interfere.

2020-09-08 16:49:58	bertptrs	the config as shipped is as close to a standard use case as you're going to get; anything else is user-specific

I'm now setting up vim using inside the terminal (termite). I added "highlight ColorColumn ctermbg=0" (0=black) and I didn't see anything. the same but with ctermbg= or 2 etc. worked. I then went and set the background color explicitly in .config/termite/config and

2020-09-14 14:29:29	th0rne	Installation guide, setting up hosts.
2020-09-14 14:29:41	th0rne	Seems like if you ever do have to reconfigure your network, it might lead to problems? But do you gain something by doing this?

2020-09-14 14:31:36	ask6155	How do I make it so that dnsmasq doesn't listen on :: and 0.0.0.0? I want to only listen on 127.0.0.1

2020-09-14 14:33:31	ask6155	I've done that but netstat still says dnsmasq is listening on 0.0.0.0 and :: and it also shows on nmap when I scan the public ip

2020-09-14 14:49:19	MrElendig	being limited to 256/512 symbols and 16/8 colours is a slight problem in 2020
2020-09-14 14:49:24	th0rne	Also syslinux supports custom resolutions.
2020-09-14 14:49:34	th0rne	You can have 1080 in syslinux.
2020-09-14 14:49:49	MrElendig	the slow speed and no multimonitor is another
2020-09-14 14:50:03	th0rne	Or I don't know about custom, but I mean syslinux doesn't need to be 800x600 or whatever.

2020-09-14 14:52:50	MacGyver	I thought that the Nvidia drivers don't ship the console driver needed for that.

2020-09-14 16:07:51	bertptrs	last thinkpad I had needed quite a few firmware updates before it stopped overheating
2020-09-14 16:07:52	MrElendig	NetSysFire: dell ended up supplying a customized windows install image to solve the catch 22
2020-09-14 16:07:57	NetSysFire	wow
2020-09-14 16:08:27	NetSysFire	well dell's firmware is also kinda special. *looks at two detected power buttons*
2020-09-14 16:08:47	Foucault_	i remember an old lab computer some 8 years ago, which only had a 16 bit ms-dos app to flash the motherboard
2020-09-14 16:09:02	genevino	Wasn't expecting that, but I actually never had problems with my Ryzen box. I really just bought it half a year ago because I had plenty of spare money, and it's so by far the most table running computer I ever had. <3 this thing.
2020-09-14 16:09:05	MrElendig	Foucault_: you can still buy boards today with that feture
2020-09-14 16:09:15	Foucault_	in fact, freedos worked fine for that
2020-09-14 16:09:16	bertptrs	for when you really need to shut your machine down. Or as a security feature? Can only shut down the machine with two people pressing buttons at opposite sides of the room?

2020-09-14 16:09:40	NetSysFire	bertptrs: no. its a virtual power button, supplied by the firmware. and it gets "pressed" when you are low on battery
2020-09-14 16:09:53	NetSysFire	i discovered this by accident

2020-09-14 16:54:36	MrElendig	you can probably find some ttf/otf font with persian symbols
2020-09-14 16:55:00	spiri	NetSysFire, i could solve the problem using arch as debugging tool
2020-09-14 16:55:15	spiri	however i also get packet loss pinging the gateway

2020-09-14 16:55:19	spiri	also did reboot of the router

2020-09-14 16:56:20	Namarrgon	Aryan: you can pick the fonts that you want from its dependencies, yes

2020-09-14 16:58:57	r3boot	1) you need to specify the credentials for a valid account on SERVER and 2) you want to use credential=/path/to/some/file/containing/credentials.conf instead of specifying them on the commandline
2020-09-14 16:59:08	Namarrgon	fkl: have you tried to not provide the username/password options?
2020-09-14 16:59:22	Namarrgon	(i assume you want to mount it as a guest)
2020-09-14 16:59:30	fkl	Namarrgon: yep
2020-09-14 16:59:35	Namarrgon	and iirc there was a 'guest' option
2020-09-14 16:59:47	r3boot	(my bad, s/credential=/credentials=/)
2020-09-14 16:59:53	spiri	NetSysFire, i don't know which information i should gather. for most of the time connection timeouts. sometimes it works but just for a few secs. all the hosts connected either per ethernet cable or per wifi is not working.
2020-09-14 17:00:06	spiri	so its a router problem not a problem on the host
2020-09-14 17:00:19	spiri	thats my guess
2020-09-14 17:00:21	fkl	Namarrgon: lemme check mount.cifs for "guest"
2020-09-14 17:00:26	NetSysFire	spiri: there are tons of guides out there that can help you

Someone recommeneded I use Pulseaudio. I installed Pulse, however unmuting there does not result in audio. I have searched the Arch wiki and haven't had much success with this issue.

2020-09-22 23:51:32	Namarrgon	and if you combine them with the Fn key?
2020-09-22 23:51:55	jussihi	I've added "acpi_backlight=vendor" to the kernel parameters, and it removes the "kernel: thinkpad_acpi: Disabling thinkpad-acpi brightness events by default..." from dmesg, but still cant see any acpi events...

2020-09-23 00:30:58	MortimerHoughton	frezy: my guess is its either a different version (and you are experiencing a problem with the non virtualization version) or you are loading different modules

2020-09-23 00:32:05	backes	does it only dump default.pa with the --dump-conf flag?
2020-09-23 00:32:06	MortimerHoughton	frezy: then my guess is that you need a module that linux-vfio is loading
2020-09-23 00:32:08	Ghotrix	backes: my guess that's it "yes" by default and pulseaudio daemon ignores systemwide config which contains "flat-volumes=no"
2020-09-23 00:32:23	backes	that would be super strange that it ignores a config
2020-09-23 00:32:32	backes	because I can't find any "flat-volume=no" in my configs
2020-09-23 00:32:40	backes	so the "default" seems to be no

2020-09-23 00:32:48	backes	whatever default means. Hardcoded? Or some config file that I'm missing

2020-09-23 02:08:16	stormsz	So not sure if this is the best place but here it goes. firefox doesnt seem to want to autoplay videos on youtube. so a video ends, i loads up a new one, it starts playing for like half a second, 1 second max and it stops and i have to start it. i double checked and i am giving permissions to youtube to autoplay "Allow Audio and Video" 
2020-09-23 02:08:37	stormsz	it loads a new one*

2020-09-23 04:07:20	yjftsjthsd	I have a semantic question as a result of a discussion from archlinux-aur: It makes sense that the AUR, these channels, etc. are for Arch Linux proper, i.e. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Code_of_conduct#Arch_Linux_distribution_support_ONLY (I mean, it's not like this is bedrock). But what constitutes a "real" Arch Linux distribution? Like,
2020-09-23 04:07:20	yjftsjthsd	if I take an Arch filesystem tarball and untar and run it in a Illumos LX-branded zone (container), is it no longer an Arch system? How about if I run it in a chroot on CentOS? In Docker? If an Arch system is only a system running official packages, does it cease to be an Arch Linux system if ex. I patch a package or taint my kernel? Where is the

2020-09-23 04:09:05	Namarrgon	you're generally on the safe side if the PKGBUILD you upload builds and functions on a "real" arch system, even if that's not the primary goal you had in mind when you uploaded it

2020-09-23 04:20:35	yjftsjthsd	Right, it's a little Ship of Theseus; shoving a RHEL kernel under an Arch system is still probably Arch, but shoving an Arch kernel under RHEL is clearly not an Arch box.

2020-09-23 04:20:51	Namarrgon	the community is more willing to support people who got all that way to their frankendistro on their own, and ignore (or even oust) people who clicked through some third-party-gui-installer and have no idea how their system works

2020-09-23 04:23:11	MacGyver	callmepk: Considering how WSL2 works by booting a linux kernel, I can very well imagine that it's possible to actually install an arch system on it.
2020-09-23 04:23:26	MacGyver	Without even having to use anything custom.
2020-09-23 04:23:29	yjftsjthsd	Yeah, I do get the impression that if I personally/manually did the steps to convert a vanilla Arch system 99% of the way into ex. a BlackArch system, it would be treated differently than if I just installed BA. Which from a support angle I guess I get, but from a philosophical angle annoys me.
2020-09-23 04:24:10	yjftsjthsd	I got the impression that at least one of the WSL images managed to break systemctl, which is kinda a big deal for a distro that's systemd-based

2020-09-23 04:29:57	eschwartz	By consensus, if you build a package yourself and install it onto an arch system, the result is still always arch (even if the package is a kernel or runit or openrc)

2020-09-23 04:31:10	eschwartz	policy so far has been containers running on a linux kernel count as arch, i.e. chroot, docker, nspawn. They still behave identical to arch, it's indistinguishable whether you run the host on centos or another arch copy
2020-09-23 04:31:44	yjftsjthsd	So in the case of WSL, the main issue is that a vanilla root fs image will not function?
2020-09-23 04:31:52	eschwartz	basically containers don't care about the host, except for which kernel the host runs
2020-09-23 04:32:07	yjftsjthsd	Right
2020-09-23 04:32:41	yjftsjthsd	Which actually could break stuff; I wonder if Arch does work in ex Docker on RHEL 6 or if it's missing syscalls that we need
2020-09-23 04:33:37	eschwartz	we'd basically just tell you "dude, get a newer kernel". But it's an extremely well defined compatibility concern
2020-09-23 04:33:57	MacGyver	One that's usually already taken care of for us by systemd.
2020-09-23 04:34:06	eschwartz	and officially we support your right to use AUR kernels and still be considered real arch 
2020-09-23 04:34:23	eschwartz	so, people use various LTS kernels
2020-09-23 04:34:27	MacGyver	As in, I've literally never seen this question raised, probably because people running this are smart enough to see systemd's minimal kernel requirements.

I've been using SSH over the VPN, and I've also set up NFS over it too. but performance has been really realy poor. there is 1-2s of latency when using ssh and writing to the nfs disk is so slow it basically doesn't work. how do I begin to diagnose this? 
2020-09-23 12:26:36	grawity	what's the latency directly to the remote?

2020-09-23 12:59:39	sseneca	I may have set this up incorrectly?
2020-09-23 12:59:53	grawity	instead, its endpoint looks very similar to what the client lists as the mullvad VPN server's IP address

2020-09-23 13:01:06	sseneca	would that be because the "endpoint" in the "server's" context is my client PC, which is connected to Mullvad's VPN server, and that's where it's receiving traffic?
2020-09-23 13:01:13	grawity	yes

2020-09-23 13:01:40	grawity	I'd say the root of the problem is that the client is configured to contact the server using your network's NATed public IP address (because of NAT, its routing table doesn't know that the address is local)
2020-09-23 13:02:05	grawity	so when mullvad app configures routing to force all non-LAN traffic through mullvad VPN, that also affects the wireguard packets going to 86.170.185.31

2020-09-23 13:05:21	sseneca	so in my client's configuration file, I have a line that says `Endpoint=vpn.ssene.ca:51820`. I have an A record that points to the IPv4 address. you want me to change the DNS record to an AAAA one (or whatever it's called) pointing to an IPv6 address?
2020-09-23 13:05:24	grawity	the more complex method (keeping the WAN IPv4 endpoint) would need adding something to `ip rule` or `ip route`... or doign the equivalent via systemd-networkd
2020-09-23 13:06:08	sseneca	the more simple the method the better
2020-09-23 13:06:16	grawity	sseneca: is the client basically a laptop that's *sometimes* in the same LAN as the server, but sometimes not?
2020-09-23 13:07:04	sseneca	grawity: no, the client is always a client. it's in the LAN for a few more days but then I'm moving and they'll be geographically separate and on different LANs
2020-09-23 13:07:40	grawity	ah, if it's going to *permanently* move to a different network, then you can go back to using the public IPv4 as soon as that happens
2020-09-23 13:08:03	grawity	though, I *would* add an AAAA record as well, because it's 2020 and you have ipv6 and you might as well use it
2020-09-23 13:08:32	sseneca	and you think adding the AAAA record will improve performance? 
2020-09-23 13:08:36	grawity	but for now, just try changing the Endpoint to 192.168.1.187:51820 or to [2a00:23c7:609e:c401:b26e:bfff:fe5f:cdc3]:51820

2020-09-23 19:09:16	frostschutz	Namarrgon, when you have a sparse filesystem image and you write it to raw disk, you can get away with not writing (zeroing) the sparse holes. if sparse hole is "free space", it won't matter what data is there. However if you punch holes into areas that were intentionally zero, you have to zero them or your files will have random data instead of zeroes in them
2020-09-23 19:09:26	frostschutz	so sparse zero and intentional zero is different

2020-09-29 14:58:48	horseface	under heavy load, it consumes resources heavily as it is.
2020-09-29 14:58:51	horseface	like ...
2020-09-29 14:58:55	grawity	Kaio-shin: you don't
2020-09-29 14:59:00	horseface	all memory, gone.
2020-09-29 14:59:05	horseface	cpu is okay...
2020-09-29 14:59:17	Kaio-shin	It has a system installed on it full arch linux
2020-09-29 14:59:27	horseface	i mean i notice no inconvenience. but still...
2020-09-29 14:59:29	grawity	I mean not impossible, but you probably need to use GRUB's loop support for getting the kernel out of it
2020-09-29 14:59:31	horseface	just weird.
2020-09-29 14:59:41	horseface	that it is so consumptive of resources.
2020-09-29 14:59:47	horseface	but fucking love this.
2020-09-29 14:59:51	Kaio-shin	any way to test it without making a seperate partition
2020-09-29 14:59:52	grawity	GRUB reads the kernel, boots it, then the initramfs has to mount the loop image anyway
2020-09-29 15:00:02	horseface	it is unbelievably good.
2020-09-29 15:00:07	Namarrgon	Kaio-shin: boot it in a vm

2020-09-29 15:00:31	horseface	that's a common happening.

2020-09-29 15:01:44	Skaface82	the only real distributed stuff you can easily do is using distcc to compile code
2020-09-29 15:01:49	grawity	frankly I'd just boot the image in qemu
2020-09-29 15:01:56	Nomenclatura	grawity: that can work. It can control vms sitting around
2020-09-29 15:02:00	grawity	Kaio-shin: take a look at aur/mkinitcpio-loop-subdir
2020-09-29 15:02:15	horseface	just wanted to provide some descriptive detail of the lqx kernel.
2020-09-29 15:02:26	horseface	so you know what it meant by tuned for performance.

2020-09-29 15:34:06	Namarrgon	the in case of passwd/shadow group/gshadow you can usually remove the pacnews since they are empty out of the box

2020-10-02 13:28:18	pippip	Hello, I have a question about file managers
2020-10-02 13:28:29	pippip	Currently I have several graphical applications which when I click 'open/save file' a small GUI file explorer window opens
2020-10-02 13:28:37	pippip	e.g. with chromium you get some kind of gtk window manager
2020-10-02 13:28:49	pippip	I wondered if it was possible to change this behaviour to use a different file manager, or even just the terminal?

2020-10-04 12:47:05	varjack	i mean, dmesg says it's authenticating
2020-10-04 12:47:16	varjack	so i feel like it's a little config thing I'm just missing
2020-10-04 12:47:26	varjack	in the kernel
2020-10-04 12:47:41	Reventlov	I'd try with an updated kernel (you never know) then :)
2020-10-04 12:47:49	varjack	agh
2020-10-04 12:48:12	varjack	see i could but this is already a bit of a tangent to my real project
2020-10-04 12:48:18	Reventlov	and might be some specific driver option (like, disabling some specific driver options)
2020-10-04 12:48:42	Reventlov	check /etc/modprobe.d/ for module specific options you might have set without remembering
2020-10-04 12:48:55	Reventlov	or your kernel boot line.

2020-10-04 12:51:19	varjack	just a script that calls wpa_supplicant and another script that sets up barebones configs :P
2020-10-04 12:51:29	varjack	up until now it was very system agnostic
2020-10-04 12:51:53	varjack	ironic the first system that fails it is a flavor of the same os I developed it on

2020-10-04 13:00:15	ville	i guess if you do "exec wm" it replaces the current process with the wm, and nothing in the script would get executed

I started into linux in college without reading or understanding the linux from a basic/foundational point of view. now that I have some time, I want to get a good base of knowleadge of the linux OS with a pragmatic point of view. Is there any books that one may recommend for me to accomplish this foundational knowleadge that may be more geared towards

2020-10-04 15:50:47	nabukadnezar43	on windows they have an utility called msi display kit which can switch profiles

2020-10-04 15:59:36	hseg	looking at the wiki page, i need to reiterate my question: are systemd-networkd/netctl/networkmanager necessary for network-online.target to behave sensibly?

2020-10-04 16:00:06	nij	My phone and others' laptops have no problem connecting to wifi. So I suspect it's a arch problem..

2020-10-04 16:54:49	nairwolf	hum, okay Corubba so /dev/mapper is a real term, not a "generic term" used as exemple
2020-10-04 16:55:20	Corubba	yes, /dev/mapper is a directory containing all device mapper devices
2020-10-04 16:55:29	Namarrgon	ty3r0x: did you check the AUR comments?
2020-10-04 16:55:48	nairwolf	okay, I'm seeing it now.
2020-10-04 16:55:54	ty3r0x	I reinstalled without removing make dependencies, now it works
2020-10-04 16:56:04	nairwolf	In fact, I already started with 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda status=progress'
2020-10-04 16:56:21	Namarrgon	why are you "wiping" it?
2020-10-04 16:56:22	nairwolf	What's the difference between this and using cryptsetup ?
2020-10-04 16:56:45	Namarrgon	/dev/zero writes zeros, if you write into the mapped drive you get noise instead

2020-10-04 16:58:36	Corubba	exactly what Namarrgon said. If you fill the drive with zeros and encrypt it afterwards, you can see what parts contain real encrypted data by looking for non-zeros. If you fill up the encrypted device, from the outside it all looks like valid encrypted data (which it is, technically)

2020-10-04 20:08:09	Ckat	why wouldnt it be?
2020-10-04 20:08:16	Ckat	those machines are still plenty capable
2020-10-04 20:08:35	ectospasm	Debian is going to be optimized for older hardware, just the nature of it.

2020-10-04 20:15:01	Ckat	its a lot of kernel loading the wrong driver with those, and you having to install the right one and blacklist whatever it uses now
2020-10-04 20:15:51	Repentinus	Figure out which kernel release caused the regression and file a bug report at bugzilla.kernel.org
2020-10-04 20:15:57	Ckat	maybe theres some weird issue with kernel version <whatever> that is going to be fixed later on and you can stick out on an older kernel for for now

2020-10-05 01:27:35	grawity	with LACP, you could connect both ports and have them working as a single 2Gbps (ish) link, and if one cable does the other remains as a 1Gbps link
2020-10-05 01:27:51	th0rne	Yes, sure, that would be optimal.
2020-10-05 01:27:55	nairwolf	okay, thank you NetSysFire and ectospasm aparently, using luksChangeKey would do the job
2020-10-05 01:27:55	kevr	th0rne: in any case, with a broken port.. i'm not sure you can safely assume what's going to happen from linux's standpoint
2020-10-05 01:28:10	th0rne	Well, let's say disconnected cable, then.

2020-10-05 01:28:12	kevr	it could just bust but still be recognized in some way, which then the software would just try to request against a broken connection
2020-10-05 01:28:17	grawity	alternative might be a bridge with RSTP, more likely to be supported but only one port at a time (just fail over)
2020-10-05 01:28:20	kevr	but yeah a disconnected should bring the iface down
2020-10-05 01:28:26	kevr	leaving your other one up
2020-10-05 01:28:28	grawity	third alternative might be VRRP

2020-10-05 01:28:53	th0rne	So LACP, if not, RSTP, if not, VRRP?
2020-10-05 01:28:54	kevr	you can also play with metrics if it ever helps you out with routes
