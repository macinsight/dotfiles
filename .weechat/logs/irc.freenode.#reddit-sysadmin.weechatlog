2020-08-19 12:08:34	ihre	Bent0: on Palos, you need to specifically enable that in the 'default' inter/intrazone rules

2020-08-19 12:09:16	Bent0	Ok. Will read through that, not that much experience with JunOS yet :-)
2020-08-19 12:09:43	Bent0	From the looks of this damn config all traffic from LAN to specific IPSec connections is allowed. But in reality its not lol
2020-08-19 12:09:48	ihre	even when all sec policies have logging enabled on PA, when the 'default' rules dont have that set, it wont log traffic for anything that hasnt specifically mentioned in the sec pol rules
2020-08-19 12:10:09	ihre	which sounds _kind_ of similar on Junos :P
2020-08-19 12:10:18	Bent0	roger
2020-08-19 12:10:27	ihre	but i havent used any junos devices for at least 3 yrs myself either
2020-08-19 12:10:34	ihre	so can't really give you any more hints than that :P
2020-08-19 12:11:21	Bent0	Hehe. Will do some more digging. This bloody idiot even had a defunct ipsec configured to his home
2020-08-19 12:12:46	ihre	hahaha, not gonna lie
2020-08-19 12:13:06	ihre	i set up ipsec between home and the palos i'm currently working on as well, just to test
2020-08-19 12:13:22	ihre	just made sure to remove that config before 'accepting them for production' :P
2020-08-19 12:13:52	Bent0	yer this has been in prod for 3 years :P

2020-08-19 12:16:39	ihre	i've just spent a couple of weeks to initially deploy some VMSeries Palos on AWS, migrating them to accounts at the moment
2020-08-19 12:16:59	ihre	i'm quite happy with them, but i suppose a vsrx on aws would be very similar
2020-08-19 12:17:37	ihre	https://www.juniper.net/assets/us/en/local/pdf/implementation-guides/8010096-en.pdf is a nice guide for vsrx on aws
2020-08-19 12:18:00	Bent0	I really have zero clue yet. Never did anything fancy with AWS. But they want to be in more than 1 DC and our current VMware setup if nearing EOL so a good moment to get all this crap out
2020-08-19 12:18:05	Bent0	cheers
2020-08-19 12:18:08	ihre	but if i'd be able to pick a vendor for 'firewalling' on aws (read: traffic inspection), i'd pick fortigate at this moment

2020-08-19 12:19:05	Bent0	I wonder if I can get away with using AWS's own routing/firewalling solution
2020-08-19 12:19:19	Bent0	I think it does not do double nat though, which some of our bigger clients require
2020-08-19 12:19:22	ihre	they dont provide any features for IDS/IPS though
2020-08-19 12:19:26	Bent0	yea
2020-08-19 12:19:27	ihre	aws that is
2020-08-19 12:19:38	ihre	which is why I had to deploy a couple of palos 
2020-08-19 12:20:18	ihre	so based on your requirements, if you need some form of traffic inspection, you cant use any aws service
2020-08-19 12:20:22	ihre	if you dont need any
2020-08-19 12:20:31	ihre	i'd just pick a regular nat gateway
2020-08-19 12:20:49	Bent0	indeed
2020-08-19 12:21:01	Bent0	Oh well. Future projects. First I need this damn route to work hehe
2020-08-19 12:21:18	ihre	i think it would only be a matter of time before they will offer such services though
2020-08-19 12:21:45	ihre	or there is some kind of agreement with ISVs to 'subcontract' that part

2020-08-19 22:48:24	+s-d	<H​otmess> yeah like the camera "server"
2020-08-19 22:49:05	+s-d	<c​ray.io> i mean, if you're running hyper-v, theres really no point in running win10 4 werkstashunz though right?
2020-08-19 22:49:08	+s-d	<H​otmess> i mean tbh normal win10 should be able to do everything win10 Workstation  dose
2020-08-19 22:49:14	+s-d	<c​ray.io> since hyper-v will handle the ECC and spanning more than 1 cpu
2020-08-19 22:49:27	onenerdyguy	you'd use Win10 Workstation if you need the features of it
2020-08-19 22:49:27	+s-d	<H​otmess> weridly win10 workstation works on hyper-v fine
2020-08-19 22:49:28	ATSChris	Just got off phone with the Vendor.  They confirmed it needs to be a re-install and they don't have any documentation since it's a Windows thing.
2020-08-19 22:49:29	onenerdyguy	in t he client
2020-08-19 22:49:39	onenerdyguy	ATSChris, so exactly what we told you to do.
2020-08-19 22:50:03	+s-d	<H​otmess> but yeah imo hyper-v server with guests is the way to go. but if your number crunching at a terminal for stuff where you need ecc it would be Win10 workstaiton
2020-08-19 22:50:13	+s-d	<H​otmess> also you need it if your using infiband

2020-08-19 22:50:30	ATSChris	Final Question:  Do I need to drive an hour there to do the re-install phyiscally?  or is there something that their IT people might have that will let me reinstall Windows remotely?
2020-08-19 22:50:36	+s-d	<H​otmess> and REFS support was dropped on normal win10
2020-08-19 22:50:59	+s-d	<H​otmess> how much you gonna bill ATSchris?
2020-08-19 22:51:03	Heresiarch	ATSChris: ask if they have out-of-band access available for the box. 90% chance they don't, but it's worth asking.
2020-08-19 22:51:28	+s-d	<H​otmess> or Mail em a PI with open vpn and and MDT running on it:)
2020-08-19 22:51:45	+s-d	<H​otmess> but at the end of the day you might have to go there and do it in person anyway
2020-08-19 22:52:06	+s-d	<H​otmess> if your getting paid by the hour bill them for the travil

A big reason we are running this thing through their machine and not a custom built one on HyperV is for the warranty and support from the Manufacturer

2020-08-19 22:56:00	ATSChris	I throw it into their rack and say, "Good luck".  They fired back this time and said, "This is an old build, please update it"
2020-08-19 22:56:18	+s-d	<H​otmess> did you point out it was LTSC?
2020-08-19 22:56:22	+s-d	<H​otmess> and thats the point
2020-08-19 22:57:04	oxipital	theoretically if thats the versionthe vendor wants for it to be supported your work is done
2020-08-19 22:57:05	ATSChris	I said "No problem, let me just run Windows Update".   I finally got around to it, started googling, and went to this chat to figure out what LTSB means
2020-08-19 22:57:26	+s-d	<H​otmess> fair enough might be time to inform the client 🙂
2020-08-19 22:57:50	ATSChris	Yeah, I think so.  A reimage is going to take their cameras down for a good amount of time.
2020-08-19 22:57:52	+s-d	<H​otmess> when they ask why you changed your answer "i was not infromed it was windows 10 LTSC at the time"
2020-08-19 22:58:11	+s-d	<H​otmess> another reason why it would be better in docker+hyper-v 🙂
2020-08-19 22:58:22	+s-d	<H​otmess> inplace high avablity during updates:)
2020-08-19 22:58:42	ATSChris	I'm positive their IT guy told me at the beginning, but I probably just read it as "Windows 10 blah blah blah" since I don't really know what I'm doing
2020-08-19 22:58:51	+s-d	<H​otmess> fair enough

2020-08-19 22:59:43	ATSChris	I don't know, this might be something covered in a formal education.  Either way, I'll file this away in the back of my brain and hopefully remember it the next time.

2020-08-20 12:30:22	Welh0	good afternoon folks!
2020-08-20 12:42:07	+s-d	<H​BK> guys i have a legit concern
2020-08-20 12:42:10	+s-d	<H​BK> we have a couple of VMS
2020-08-20 12:42:27	+s-d	<H​BK> 1 of them is a Mangement Server, where we have backups running, AV on permise
2020-08-20 12:42:34	+s-d	<H​BK> but this vm has complete internet access
2020-08-20 12:42:37	+s-d	<H​BK> is that a good thing ?
2020-08-20 12:43:05	rpifan_	hi
2020-08-20 12:43:14	+s-d	<A​cen> not really
2020-08-20 12:44:01	+s-d	<A​cen> maybe someone allowed full internet access so the AV could update itself
2020-08-20 12:44:13	+s-d	<A​cen> but didnt bother to figure out the URLs it needs
2020-08-20 12:45:57	rpifan_	thats a good point
2020-08-20 12:46:12	rpifan_	i should disable internet access to our backup making vm
2020-08-20 12:48:00	+s-d	<H​BK> yep thats right
2020-08-20 12:48:14	+s-d	<H​BK> we are moving over to Cloud Bases Endpoint
2020-08-20 12:48:21	+s-d	<H​BK> so its best we disable internet ?
2020-08-20 12:48:23	+s-d	<H​BK> how about the NAS
2020-08-20 12:48:32	+s-d	<H​BK> even our nas has internet access
2020-08-20 12:48:43	+s-d	<H​BK> i can update via the control pannel
2020-08-20 12:51:54	rpifan_	well r u using it from the internets
2020-08-20 12:52:14	+s-d	<H​BK> u mean the NAS
2020-08-20 12:52:19	+s-d	<H​BK> no NAS works when i connect to VPN
2020-08-20 12:52:20	+s-d	<H​BK> only
2020-08-20 12:52:26	+s-d	<H​BK> but they have internet access
2020-08-20 12:52:29	+s-d	<H​BK> which is techincally not good
2020-08-20 12:52:32	+s-d	<H​BK> right
2020-08-20 12:52:46	+s-d	<H​BK> we have kaspersky av
2020-08-20 12:52:55	+s-d	<H​BK> question is our user machines go out of date
2020-08-20 12:53:12	+s-d	<H​BK> because our polciy can sync and update only when they connect to VPN or in office
2020-08-20 12:53:16	+s-d	<H​BK> so this is  bad bard
2020-08-20 12:53:21	rpifan_	idk
2020-08-20 12:53:29	rpifan_	seems bad but im not an expert
2020-08-20 12:53:41	meo	you should be doing it exactly the other way around
2020-08-20 12:54:01	meo	you dont disable internet access, it's disabled by default, you only enable it when and as much as necessary
2020-08-20 12:56:21	+s-d	<H​BK> mean meo
2020-08-20 12:56:46	+s-d	<H​BK> u mean for the VM ?
2020-08-20 12:56:46	+s-d	<H​BK> oh for this VM managment nope its not disabled
2020-08-20 12:56:47	+s-d	<H​BK> even the internet explorer can just browse through just like that
2020-08-20 12:56:54	+s-d	<H​BK> it doesnt have the warning message like its has limited function

2020-08-20 22:23:41	notsponsible	So I'm stumped and could use some help.  I have a Windows 10 PC with an enter key that doesn't work in user mode, it happens to be the CEOs computer.  It works to login to the machine, and if I run a program with administrative privileges it works at the UAC prompt but nowhere else.  The on screen keyboard has the same problem.  The problem happens across user accounts on this one PC.  My only saving grace is that Shift+Enter does work.

2020-08-21 18:39:09	+s-d	<r​mg22893> @enfieldvball you should always be setting up LAPS. If a user absolutely requires admin credentials you can grant that on their machine on a case by case basis. And as ahendrix said, most applications don't truly need admin access, application compatibility toolkit can usually shim them into running without

2020-08-21 22:40:36	PublicWiFi	ME1's gameplay was kinda bad but the lore and storytelling was great imo
2020-08-21 22:40:42	PublicWiFi	ME2 expanded it a lot, and was real fun
2020-08-21 22:40:51	PublicWiFi	then ME3 had the best combat but shit on the lore
2020-08-21 22:41:00	PublicWiFi	im still salty about it

2020-08-21 22:41:39	shibboleth	and me2 nailed it
2020-08-21 22:41:50	shibboleth	yes, space-arnold was dumb
2020-08-21 22:41:56	shibboleth	really, really dumb
2020-08-21 22:42:03	shibboleth	but man was ME2 great

2020-08-21 22:42:39	shibboleth	i dunno why the 25 seconds of clint mansell in me3 is such a big deal

2020-08-23 06:18:42	+s-d	<K​raftik> and maybe someday it will say, worry a little.  Something will go wrong soon if you don't
2020-08-23 06:18:53	+s-d	<K​raftik> Everything is wrong HELP!!!!
2020-08-23 06:18:58	Yes__Officer	haha Kraftik... remember if you arent getting alerts, you dont have any problems
2020-08-23 06:18:58	+s-d	<K​raftik> when its too late
2020-08-23 06:19:22	+a1	unless the alert server goes down and you don't get emails :(
2020-08-23 06:19:28	+a1	but then i guess it's out of sight out of mind
2020-08-23 06:19:41	+s-d	<K​raftik> eventually you get an alert, in the form of an angree phone call
2020-08-23 06:19:46	Yes__Officer	we have all been there
2020-08-23 06:19:54	+a1	i have one alert that goes out every day at noon for me
2020-08-23 06:19:55	Yes__Officer	or an escalation from someone who never reached out
2020-08-23 06:20:43	+s-d	<K​raftik> i feel like graylog would be great
2020-08-23 06:21:11	+s-d	<K​raftik> but its too extensive for what i'd need as an immediate solution
2020-08-23 06:22:02	+s-d	<K​raftik> I need to sit down and read and study it for a while before I can implament it properly
2020-08-23 06:22:05	Yes__Officer	its better to have a few features you are not using

2020-08-23 06:24:30	Yes__Officer	if I were in your shoes, id spend an hour finding something to hold you over (greylog is a good start) 
2020-08-23 06:24:35	Yes__Officer	and then update in the future if you need it
2020-08-23 06:24:55	+s-d	<K​raftik> I was gonna go for a python script to be honest

2020-08-23 06:25:22	+s-d	<K​raftik> well the important parts aren't
2020-08-23 06:25:49	+s-d	<K​raftik> I just need to make sure the server is on, and no major power loss and it has access to the resources it needs
2020-08-23 06:26:05	+s-d	<K​raftik> and we don't run out of data storage space
2020-08-23 06:26:27	+s-d	<K​raftik> maybe avg temp updates so we can tell if a fan blew out
2020-08-23 06:26:36	+s-d	<K​raftik> and avg hard drive usage
2020-08-23 06:26:47	+s-d	<K​raftik> so we can tell if there is issues with speed
2020-08-23 06:26:53	Yes__Officer	you are starting to rack up the lines in python ATM
2020-08-23 06:27:04	Yes__Officer	you are probably at the same ROI of installing and configuring greylog
2020-08-23 06:27:25	+s-d	<K​raftik> well, if i can get data storage space
2020-08-23 06:27:33	+s-d	<K​raftik> as a minimum that be good to hold me over
2020-08-23 06:27:52	+s-d	<K​raftik> then I'd feel comfortable learning greylog
2020-08-23 06:28:05	+s-d	<K​raftik> but hey stress is a good motivator right?
2020-08-23 06:28:08	Yes__Officer	sounds like you ahve a plan of attack

2020-08-23 08:49:04	+s-d	<m​atthew> I doubt you need more than 40Gbit to the router or 20Gbit HA

2020-08-23 20:18:23	usrGabriel	Fair enough, I'm actually in the process of building one with Proxmox. Building templates with Packer, and hopefully deploy labs with Ansible.
2020-08-23 20:18:40	usrGabriel	So far, having good success with Packer.
2020-08-23 20:19:42	usrGabriel	So basically, practice? What do you do when say, you don't feel the motivation?
2020-08-23 20:21:36	fritzwastaken	Smoke some weed, watch a youtube video on it instead of reading about it
2020-08-23 20:23:25	fritzwastaken	PublicWiFi! I got another person on the minecraft server!
2020-08-23 20:24:07	usrGabriel	@fritzwastaken Alright, well, weed is legal here if worst comes to worst haha!
2020-08-23 20:24:36	+s-d	<C​olour> usrGabriel I dunno tbh I've always been confident in my ability to fix things because I've worked shitty MSP all my life I guess. I try things. I try to understand things out of my ability. I try to set things up so common tasks are easier to do if I can. I take breaks when everything gets a bit too much.
2020-08-23 20:24:59	+s-d	<C​olour> Getting a home server ASAP is highly recommended
2020-08-23 20:25:00	fritzwastaken	Working at an MSP was the best thing I could have done at the start of my career
2020-08-23 20:25:07	fritzwastaken	and yea, a homelab is huuuuge
2020-08-23 20:25:10	+s-d	<C​olour> MSP is great at the start of your career yeah
2020-08-23 20:25:29	fritzwastaken	4 years of an MSP set me up really nicely as a generalist
2020-08-23 20:25:34	fritzwastaken	got to see a whole lot of things
2020-08-23 20:25:38	fritzwastaken	good bad and ugly
2020-08-23 20:27:45	usrGabriel	@+s-d Yeah you've probably seen a lot through that! That's pretty good! I have to say that I kinda jumped on sysadmin train pretty early, so there are many things that can be considered "basic" that have I not really done yet. Basically, missing spots in my knowledge, as well as kinda rusty networking knowledge, but I am pretty decent at Linux/Automation stuff.
2020-08-23 20:28:15	usrGabriel	Alright, I think the Proxmox home lab will pretty much fix all of that.
2020-08-23 20:28:25	usrGabriel	Or, at least, mostly.

2020-08-25 08:26:34	enix	What is a "Port PVID Configuration"
2020-08-25 08:26:54	enix	PVID - Specify the VLAN ID you want assigned to untagged or priority tagged frames received on this port. The factory default is 1. The possible range is (1 to 4093).
2020-08-25 08:27:06	enix	Why can't I just untag the port? dafuq is a pvid
2020-08-25 08:28:10	@mkosmo	sounds like it's the vlan assigned to untagged traffic according to that

2020-08-25 08:31:59	enix	This "Smart" switch is very confusing. I untagged a port then I go to the "PVID Configuration" and it just says its tagged...
2020-08-25 08:32:29	enix	"Untagged ports are member of a vlan and PVID is for non tagged packets arriving at a port on the switch"
2020-08-25 08:32:34	enix	Whats "non tagged"
2020-08-25 08:33:02	@mkosmo	a frame without a .1q tag?
2020-08-25 08:34:32	jay-ros	ummm I think it's switch to switch enix
2020-08-25 08:34:54	jay-ros	like, if you're connecting multiple switches, and native is there on the switch, it carries the 'vlan tag' over to the next hop
2020-08-25 08:35:04	enix	So if your backbones vlan was like 100 then you could set the pvid to 100 on the ports that the up/down link are?
2020-08-25 08:35:06	jay-ros	so if you've got seperated vlans they can communicate
2020-08-25 08:35:50	jay-ros	yeah

2020-08-25 08:36:11	jay-ros	ahhh
2020-08-25 08:36:39	jay-ros	you're running a blue line which runs 40% copper ore
2020-08-25 08:36:53	jay-ros	40% iron ore and 20% coal from a remote mining site
2020-08-25 08:37:06	enix	On one conveyer belt? 
2020-08-25 08:37:06	jay-ros	it has its own power from a nearby water resource
2020-08-25 08:37:09	enix	Sounds like spaghetti
2020-08-25 08:37:09	jay-ros	yeah
2020-08-25 08:37:30	jay-ros	and you run filtered inserters at two depots
2020-08-25 08:37:38	jay-ros	the tagging is the filtered inserters
2020-08-25 08:37:55	enix	What would untaging be

2020-08-25 08:38:14	jay-ros	"copper ore" is the vlan tag, so no matter what is coming down the line, it knows to handle that ore if it appears
2020-08-25 08:38:40	jay-ros	untagging would be just all traffic, a stack inserer
2020-08-25 08:38:43	jay-ros	inserter
2020-08-25 08:39:05	jay-ros	if it is taken off the belt, then stuff further down the line can handle it
2020-08-25 08:39:20	enix	i think this just made it more confusion lmfao
2020-08-25 08:39:38	@d1	pro-tip
2020-08-25 08:39:41	jay-ros	untagged is port to switch
2020-08-25 08:39:42	@d1	tag everything
2020-08-25 08:39:46	jay-ros	like server to switch
2020-08-25 08:39:51	jay-ros	server doesn't give a fuck
2020-08-25 08:39:55	jay-ros	it gets data

2020-08-25 08:40:12	jay-ros	unmanaged switch handles data the same, comes in comes out
2020-08-25 08:40:28	jay-ros	if you vlan tag a port, server port needs to be tagged for that vlan to accept data
2020-08-25 08:41:03	jay-ros	or a switch to switch needs a tag if you're passing a particular vlan through it
2020-08-25 08:41:12	enix	oh god i should tell you about my test lab sometime
2020-08-25 08:41:14	enix	maybe tomorrow
2020-08-25 08:41:39	jay-ros	and native is when an untagged frame comes to a port which has vlans handled
2020-08-25 08:41:55	jay-ros	it's a "what the fuck is this" piece of data
2020-08-25 08:42:10	jay-ros	and you can say "native vlan 3" and vlan 3 is then the "WTF port"
2020-08-25 08:42:28	enix	To me, "tagged" means "you can use one of these vlans if you know how to". Untagged means "you get this vlan"
2020-08-25 08:42:31	jay-ros	pass vlan 3 over to another switch, and the other switch can see if it handles it
2020-08-25 08:43:03	@d1	untagged means it doesn't have the vlan header in front of the packet

2020-08-25 08:43:27	jay-ros	the packet of data is like this [DATA]

2020-08-25 08:43:36	enix	ya
2020-08-25 08:43:46	jay-ros	then you send it [Source][Destination][Data]

2020-08-25 08:43:53	enix	okyday

2020-08-25 08:44:19	enix	oh god.. okay
2020-08-25 08:44:20	jay-ros	[tag] can be 'null'
2020-08-25 08:44:25	jay-ros	which is untagged
2020-08-25 08:44:31	enix	in cisco or hp land
2020-08-25 08:44:35	enix	or all the lands?
2020-08-25 08:44:36	@d1	yes
2020-08-25 08:44:36	jay-ros	yeah
2020-08-25 08:44:43	jay-ros	all of them, it's a standard
2020-08-25 08:44:46	enix	okay
2020-08-25 08:44:49	enix	I'm following
2020-08-25 08:44:54	jay-ros	FCS - frame check sequence
2020-08-25 08:45:00	jay-ros	then the switch is told how to handle [tag]
2020-08-25 08:45:14	enix	Right
2020-08-25 08:45:24	jay-ros	if it's 'null' then the switch goes "eh? this looks like unhandled data"
2020-08-25 08:45:40	jay-ros	and directs it to the rules set on the switch's 'native vlan'
2020-08-25 08:46:10	jay-ros	if you put a trunk port to a second switch enabling native vlan, it will advertise the data down that port to the next switch, which will look at the data as well
2020-08-25 08:46:18	@d1	jay-ros++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2020-08-25 08:46:28	enix	whats a trunk port
2020-08-25 08:46:43	jay-ros	like a bridge for traffic between switches
2020-08-25 08:46:56	@d1	handles multiple vlans on a single port
2020-08-25 08:46:58	jay-ros	"the other end of this connection handles multiple data types and handles headers"
2020-08-25 08:46:59	enix	So I think this is where I get a little hung up
2020-08-25 08:47:11	enix	How do I define that trunk/bridge
2020-08-25 08:47:18	jay-ros	what device are you using

2020-08-25 11:16:43	WhitePretzel	Huge respect to sysadmins
2020-08-25 11:17:01	humpaxx	Could there be a setting in the java app then thats missing for it to work with the name domain name?
2020-08-25 11:17:19	WhitePretzel	Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
2020-08-25 11:17:21	WhitePretzel	Possible
2020-08-25 11:17:24	WhitePretzel	Possibly*
2020-08-25 11:17:50	humpaxx	But you said you could access both apps via tomcat using the URLs. like localhost:8080/app1 and localhost:8080/app2
2020-08-25 11:17:52	humpaxx	? 
2020-08-25 11:18:16	WhitePretzel	yea
2020-08-25 11:18:34	humpaxx	Aha so thats what the <Location> thing is for in the apache config then i guess
2020-08-25 11:19:07	WhitePretzel	the httpd.conf?
2020-08-25 11:19:36	humpaxx	yes, if it mentions the /app1 thing 
2020-08-25 11:20:04	WhitePretzel	<Location> thingy mah jig?
2020-08-25 11:21:06	humpaxx	Ok, so this error 503, it started after you moved the application to a different server and changed the external URL?
2020-08-25 11:22:35	WhitePretzel	The app was always in the same server. It was only approachable through localhost when we got it and now we are trying to make it to an external URL
2020-08-25 11:22:57	humpaxx	You said it "Somehat worked" with an old (external) URL?
2020-08-25 11:23:55	WhitePretzel	The previous company who handled the server uploaded the app (new app) to their own domain and it worked there and now we are trying to combine the 2 apps on the server into 1 domain
2020-08-25 11:24:17	WhitePretzel	or 1 app in site.com and 1 new app in sub.site.com
2020-08-25 11:24:22	WhitePretzel	Which is what im trying to do
2020-08-25 11:24:37	humpaxx	Ah.

2020-08-25 11:32:34	humpaxx	Well what i would do to try and see if its a domain-setting in the java app is copy a new httpd config, set the ServerName to the old (working one) for app2 to that, add the IP of the apache2 server to my hosts file to point the old domain to the apache server
2020-08-25 11:33:42	humpaxx	to see if the "somewhat worked" domain of app2 works with apache2 through the proxy. and if it does fiddle with app2 until it works with the sub.site.com URL 
2020-08-25 11:34:25	humpaxx	Now i have to get back to work but i hope those two cents works

2020-08-25 13:08:58	+s-d	<m​ikael> i dont need any detailed thing
2020-08-25 13:09:02	+s-d	<m​ikael> just something where i can write all this down
2020-08-25 13:09:07	+s-d	<m​ikael> a "documatnetaion system"
2020-08-25 13:09:31	+s-d	<l​ind> does the actual roles change?
2020-08-25 13:09:58	+s-d	<m​ikael> depends if they change ambulance yes, happens like 1 or twice in 2-3 weeks routine
2020-08-25 13:10:30	+s-d	<l​ind> i dont know, it feels best pulling it from the db, keeping this kinda thing by hand is doomed to fail
2020-08-25 13:10:53	+s-d	<m​ikael> yep, but i just want to it with my coworker to avoid troubles
2020-08-25 13:11:00	+s-d	<m​ikael> so we have something in hand
2020-08-25 13:11:10	+s-d	<m​ikael> yep, but i just want to do it with my coworker to avoid troubles (edited)
2020-08-25 13:11:50	+s-d	<l​ind> if it isn't accurate it wont do that though? :) 
2020-08-25 13:11:50	+s-d	<l​ind> but alright, not sure what would suit you honestly
2020-08-25 13:12:30	+s-d	<m​ikael> yea
2020-08-25 13:12:34	+s-d	<m​ikael> just internal things
2020-08-25 13:12:39	+s-d	<m​ikael> no need to further explain here
2020-08-25 13:12:49	+s-d	<m​ikael> but its enough for me to write down in 1 sentence all of this
2020-08-25 13:12:52	+s-d	<m​ikael> i know its stupid and weird
2020-08-25 13:12:58	+s-d	<m​ikael> but using a excel sheet saved my job
2020-08-25 13:13:09	+s-d	<l​ind> what about an excel sheet then?
2020-08-25 13:13:09	+s-d	<m​ikael> now i want something thats working in web
2020-08-25 13:13:12	+s-d	<l​ind> ah
2020-08-25 13:13:25	+s-d	<l​ind> alright then
2020-08-25 13:13:37	+s-d	<l​ind> you want something thats hosted or?
2020-08-25 13:13:42	+s-d	<m​ikael> something web based, thats selfhosted and free
2020-08-25 13:14:51	+s-d	<m​ikael> because i want to use it for more things like: documentation for me and my coworker, or sharing stuff
2020-08-25 13:15:05	+s-d	<m​ikael> etc.
2020-08-25 13:16:08	+s-d	<m​ikael> i should mention: i found some solutions and wrote them down, but i was curious what you guys here were using (if youre even using something like this)
2020-08-25 13:16:28	+s-d	<l​ind> still kinda hazy on what you're doing honestly ;)
2020-08-25 13:16:32	+s-d	<l​ind> what did you find that fits?

(if i need to restart a kiosk device that isn't powered by a poe port that i can bounce by disabling and enabling PoE on that port)

2020-08-25 13:40:40	catbeard	it works to bypass firewalls because it's listening on the LAN interface, and a remote to local port forward back into the network, so it's in response to an outbound connection
2020-08-25 13:42:56	catbeard	so on the public gateway you just do ssh -l siteb_tunnel_user -p FORWARDED_LOCAL_PORT

2020-08-25 15:44:36	ihre	my will -> lower right
2020-08-25 15:45:58	estranger	depends on your assets too... if you have no kids and your money is basically 401k or other things you assign beneficiaries to, prob not much need for a will (if no kids)
2020-08-25 15:48:11	estranger	sunrunner, here you thought about a healthcare POA ?

2020-08-25 17:29:35	JollyRgrs	and make sure the raid-5 "drive letter" is the same (or you'll have to edit the XML files to point to the correct new path)

2020-08-25 17:40:48	JollyRgrs	that's very high level for one of them
2020-08-25 17:40:52	corona266	oh jeez
2020-08-25 17:41:01	JollyRgrs	it was hard enough for them to describe how to get an IP (either by GUI or by cmd line)
2020-08-25 17:41:16	corona266	nah, most of the people applying have a masters, doctorates, or equivalent years of experience
2020-08-25 17:41:52	JollyRgrs	i list on my resume what I A) actually know well enough to speak to in an interview and B) actually what I want to work on
2020-08-25 17:42:10	JollyRgrs	I don't want to talk in depth about TCP/IP nor do I want a job that revolves around that
2020-08-25 17:42:27	+s-d	<l​ind> only a real sicko would
2020-08-25 17:42:40	JollyRgrs	i also just have the assumption that ppl in my field know enough about "IP, LAN, TCP/IP" for their jobs to function
2020-08-25 17:43:15	corona266	I wonder if we could ask something like "what does the packet for a SYN look like"

2020-08-25 17:43:36	+s-d	<H​otmess> Quiz em about multicast
2020-08-25 17:43:37	JollyRgrs	talking about changes in micro/pico seconds
2020-08-25 17:43:39	ihre	fool we only use udp
2020-08-25 17:43:47	ihre	:^)
2020-08-25 17:43:59	+s-d	<H​otmess> Seriously ask em about multicast address ranges
2020-08-25 17:44:00	corona266	microseconds kinda of matter a bit, picoseconds? nah
2020-08-25 17:44:00	JollyRgrs	corona266: like a blonde in a red dress walking down the street?

2020-08-25 17:44:24	+s-d	<H​otmess> You can quiz em on ipv6 all hosts and all routers address
2020-08-25 17:44:40	corona266	wtf is an ARP and why does it have a stupid name
2020-08-25 17:44:54	+s-d	<H​otmess> And their ipv4 equivalent it's obscure enough to be difficult but east enough to not be an arse
2020-08-25 17:45:03	JollyRgrs	when i used to sit on interviews for tier 1/2 help... we'd ask like "what is IPv6" just to see if they were aware of it and had GENERAL knowledge
2020-08-25 17:45:17	+s-d	<H​otmess> Is on ccnp so it's about the lvl u are looking for
2020-08-25 17:45:21	JollyRgrs	got everything from like dns security to who knows what
2020-08-25 17:45:23	JollyRgrs	HILARIOUS!
2020-08-25 17:45:30	corona266	yea... we had a guy interview for the senior SA position and didn't know about TLS1.3
2020-08-25 17:45:43	JollyRgrs	interviewing ITT Tech graduates? 10/10 would recommend... pls video and get releases signed to share the video after
2020-08-25 17:45:54	+s-d	<H​otmess> I mean tbh I don't know much about TLS 1.3 other than to run it
2020-08-25 17:46:06	@c1	does itt tech still exist?
2020-08-25 17:46:10	corona266	i mean me neither, but i at least know it exists
2020-08-25 17:46:18	tapoxi	I mean its pretty new
2020-08-25 17:46:19	+s-d	<H​otmess> If he's there as a sec guy yeah he should know about it
2020-08-25 17:46:23	JollyRgrs	I enjoy interview questions where you ask a "simple" question and there's many right answers, but how in-depth they go will show a lot of how much they actually know
2020-08-25 17:46:24	tapoxi	I think most people only care about 1.2
2020-08-25 17:46:29	+s-d	<H​otmess> But otherwise I'd skip
2020-08-25 17:46:41	JollyRgrs	c1: no

2020-08-25 17:46:58	corona266	well the question was about TLS/SSL in general and managing certs, so can't really skip
2020-08-25 17:46:59	JollyRgrs	and student loans to them were wiped

2020-08-25 17:51:06	HumanIndividual	We're not allowed to ask any questions off-script because it'd be unfair to other applicants that didn't get the same question, so there are like 5 questions per job, and generally they're fucking insane

2020-08-25 17:56:02	estranger	tapoxi, that would get you right to the technical interviews lol
2020-08-25 17:56:15	+s-d	<H​otmess> I am literally of the opinion classic and their players are actively ruining wow
2020-08-25 17:56:18	estranger	corona266, we try to not do that :) we're not dickbags

2020-08-25 18:00:49	+s-d	<H​otmess> In all honesty the open world zones are the least exciting as they are static

2020-08-25 18:02:17	+s-d	<H​otmess> Or u know I could run that D2 map again for the 1000th time that never changes

2020-08-26 15:33:08	+s-d	<H​otmess> you could just get it to call google translate and be done with it

2020-08-26 15:35:19	+s-d	<H​otmess> bing has translation too not sure if its anygoood
2020-08-26 15:35:56	+s-d	<P​ikachu> probably ends up translating to swedish

2020-08-26 15:36:28	+s-d	<A​nathema@Work> pretty impressed actually, I just did a quick test

2020-08-26 15:36:44	+s-d	<H​otmess> nice
2020-08-26 15:36:56	+s-d	<H​otmess> bing dosnt get enough love tbh. i quite like it
2020-08-26 15:37:08	+s-d	<A​nathema@Work> Let's test how well Google is able to translate a simple sentence between English, Finnish and Icelandic. Exciting!
2020-08-26 15:37:08	+s-d	<A​nathema@Work> 
2020-08-26 15:37:08	+s-d	<A​nathema@Work> Testataan, kuinka hyvin Google pystyy kääntämään yksinkertaisen lauseen englannin, suomen ja islannin välillä. Jännittävä!

2020-08-26 15:38:04	+s-d	<A​lexis 🐼 [a grill ]> Random question: is there a hardware tool that can tell you how much GB a ram stick has? I’ve got like 50 sticks I need to identify/sort for work and I don’t fancy plugging them into a mobo, booting it up, looking at the system screen, turning it off, and doing it over again 50 times
2020-08-26 15:38:23	+s-d	<H​otmess> powershell
2020-08-26 15:38:32	+s-d	<H​otmess> will get you the disc szie
2020-08-26 15:38:41	+s-d	<P​ikachu> uh
2020-08-26 15:38:49	+s-d	<P​ikachu> read the labels is probably quicker than plugging them in
2020-08-26 15:39:06	+s-d	<A​nathema@Work> don't they have like a parts number printed on them or something?
2020-08-26 15:39:08	+s-d	<H​otmess> alot of times the labeles are worng
2020-08-26 15:39:08	+s-d	<P​ikachu> like, the RAM DIMMs themselves would be labelled
2020-08-26 15:39:16	+s-d	<A​lexis 🐼 [a grill ]> Oem sticks - all I’ve got are numbers and letters no real labels
2020-08-26 15:39:18	+s-d	<P​ikachu> and if all else fails, read the RAM ICs themselves
2020-08-26 15:39:29	+s-d	<P​ikachu> numbers and letters are often model numbers
2020-08-26 15:40:07	+s-d	<A​cen> plug them into an old server with like 20 slots
2020-08-26 15:40:23	+s-d	<A​lexis 🐼 [a grill ]> Can’t read the ICs : this is from an iron foundry so the “writing” on the chips have worn away from the metal dust that gets in the computers
2020-08-26 15:40:36	+s-d	<P​ikachu> :pikathonk:
2020-08-26 15:40:47	+s-d	<P​ikachu> Hell I'd be more concerned about them still working and not shorted out
2020-08-26 15:41:12	+s-d	<A​lexis 🐼 [a grill ]> Well. I’ll figure it out. I also brought home some spare PCs that they came from so I’ll just do the old tried and true method.

2020-08-26 15:41:54	+s-d	<H​otmess> in powershell should get your drive size info you can just dump that to csv

2020-08-26 15:42:24	+s-d	<H​otmess> oh ram
2020-08-26 15:42:27	+s-d	<A​lexis 🐼 [a grill ]> Lol okay
2020-08-26 15:42:28	+s-d	<P​ikachu> it's windows, will probably randomly give you RAM capacity
2020-08-26 15:42:30	+s-d	<H​otmess> yeah sorry

2020-08-26 15:42:45	+s-d	<H​otmess> i mean yeah boot to linux then just pull the info

2020-08-26 15:43:04	+s-d	<A​cen> if they dont blow up cuz theyre shorted out
2020-08-26 15:43:05	+s-d	<H​otmess> you can get the info out of ps for ram using hwinfo
2020-08-26 15:43:16	+s-d	<H​otmess> but windows dosnet like swapping ram alot
2020-08-26 15:43:18	+s-d	<P​ikachu> I'd be weary that some of them don't have iron dust and short out
2020-08-26 15:43:26	+s-d	<A​cen> blowing up any type of chip is always fun
2020-08-26 15:43:30	+s-d	<H​otmess> if you got a uefi bios that will give you the ram info

2020-08-26 16:32:04	onenerdyguy	yep. 1 man shop here, 0 dollars, but made it work. Did the full 'we're going open source' trip
2020-08-26 16:32:10	Jaelae	private catholic school where the 3 years before i got hired they had people steal money
2020-08-26 16:32:26	Jaelae	I setup linux LTSP on a lot of the teacher desktops 
2020-08-26 16:32:41	onenerdyguy	I tried LTSP. It worked, but I ended up with Ubermix on the desktops
2020-08-26 16:33:01	onenerdyguy	then managing those led me to learn saltstack, which led me to hate saltstack, which led me to ansible
2020-08-26 16:33:29	Jaelae	ltsp worked it was a good idea but at the time these were old desktops with floppy disks so i had to boot from floppy to load the server running it :)
2020-08-26 16:33:46	Jaelae	then i saw the public high school i went to had gotten so much funding they had some amazing stuff
2020-08-26 16:34:02	onenerdyguy	i mean, private schools either go the full on 'we have nothing' route, or the 'we have everything hanks donors" route

2020-08-26 19:13:11	PublicWiFi	meh we're all gonna get it eventually I think
2020-08-26 19:13:21	PublicWiFi	its gonna be added to the coronaviruses in circulation now
2020-08-26 19:13:24	PublicWiFi	common cold, etc
2020-08-26 19:13:44	PublicWiFi	i thought this was all about flattening the curve, when did the goal post change to total isolatoin until its gone
2020-08-26 19:15:33	+AnonymooseReddtr	PublicWiFi are you in the US?
2020-08-26 19:15:43	PublicWiFi	yeah!
2020-08-26 19:15:50	misspwn	can't speak for that because it will make me seem like i'm harboring some irrational fears. i'm high risk so we're doin our part in a place that is a giant hot spot
2020-08-26 19:16:09	+AnonymooseReddtr	PublicWiFi ... the US isn't flattening the curve at all
2020-08-26 19:16:10	+AnonymooseReddtr	well
2020-08-26 19:16:17	misspwn	it wasn't until i said something at work that they started telling folks to wear masks
2020-08-26 19:16:32	PublicWiFi	flattening the curve relative to hospital capacity
2020-08-26 19:16:46	PublicWiFi	that was the original argument
2020-08-26 19:16:54	PublicWiFi	and we're passed that point now
2020-08-26 19:17:10	PublicWiFi	the fact is this is gonna burn through at this point
2020-08-26 19:18:00	PublicWiFi	i get if you're high risk do you
2020-08-26 19:18:12	PublicWiFi	but im not gonna live in fear of a 99.7% death rate when im a healthy adult
2020-08-26 19:18:17	PublicWiFi	err
2020-08-26 19:18:19	PublicWiFi	0.03% death rate*
2020-08-26 19:18:32	PublicWiFi	i bet my chances of dying on the way to work are greater than that
2020-08-26 19:18:38	misspwn	eh i don't think we should live in fear, we all need to make calculated risks we are comfortable with.
2020-08-26 19:18:43	PublicWiFi	right!
2020-08-26 19:18:49	PublicWiFi	im not hating on people wearing masks and stuff either
2020-08-26 19:18:52	PublicWiFi	do you boo boo
2020-08-26 19:19:13	+s-d	<O​ddyKnocky> sure, but i think the argument is to help others not necessarily yourself
2020-08-26 19:19:22	+s-d	<f​elda> english muffins slap
2020-08-26 19:19:26	+s-d	<O​ddyKnocky> people who take quarantine seriously because they are at risk have to go out in the world eventually
2020-08-26 19:19:36	misspwn	if everyone continues to wear masks and be smart about situations we'll keep it from spiking and avoid having to go into full shut downs. it may not be perfect but it sure as hell better than what it was without
2020-08-26 19:19:37	PublicWiFi	fact is YOU are ultimately responsible for your well being
2020-08-26 19:19:43	+s-d	<f​elda> that's wrong bruh
2020-08-26 19:19:50	+s-d	<O​ddyKnocky> lol you can't be serious
2020-08-26 19:19:51	PublicWiFi	its all about of the calculated risk misspwn was talking about
2020-08-26 19:20:20	+s-d	<f​elda> everyone plays a part in this considering you don't have a choice if some numpty wanders around even tho they are positive
2020-08-26 19:20:20	+s-d	<O​ddyKnocky> so if i have covid and i cough in your face, is that your fault?
2020-08-26 19:20:26	PublicWiFi	its the truth, and im saying this as a guy who wears masks in the grocery store lol
2020-08-26 19:20:28	+AnonymooseReddtr	yes 
2020-08-26 19:20:41	+AnonymooseReddtr	i wear a mask when i'm in a public place
2020-08-26 19:20:44	PublicWiFi	^

2020-08-26 19:21:14	PublicWiFi	but the odds are someone isn't going to do that
2020-08-26 19:21:14	Fritzwastaken	in the US, yes
2020-08-26 19:21:23	PublicWiFi	lol
2020-08-26 19:21:29	PublicWiFi	sad
2020-08-26 19:21:30	misspwn	i feel fine about the day care situation. it's the schools that aren't ready yet. the ratio for children in daycare is way low and more controlled
2020-08-26 19:21:32	+s-d	<f​elda> not to mention we don't know the long term health effects of COVID yet
2020-08-26 19:21:33	+AnonymooseReddtr	if you are american? you're not doing your duty if not wearing a vest and carrrying an AR dude
2020-08-26 19:21:41	misspwn	my 3 year old has been in this whole time
2020-08-26 19:21:48	PublicWiFi	i really want an AR so bad
2020-08-26 19:21:54	+AnonymooseReddtr	misspwn yeah i am a little worried about schools
2020-08-26 19:22:03	+s-d	<O​ddyKnocky> smh, imagine not wearing your public school issued kevlar vest
2020-08-26 19:22:29	PublicWiFi	i was reading about some cool work arounds for teachers who are older or high risk
2020-08-26 19:22:32	+s-d	<f​elda> not taking your school issues glock with you to the bathroom, it's like you wanted to get shot
2020-08-26 19:22:37	PublicWiFi	cause children are basically golden when it comes ot being sick
2020-08-26 19:22:37	 *	Fritzwastaken sits back petting my cat not worrying about schools or childcare
2020-08-26 19:22:40	misspwn	AnonymooseReddtr, whereas drop kid off at the door, temp checked hands washed, day care workers wear masks, and don't change rooms. they still go out to play but 5 kids in a class is much lower risk
2020-08-26 19:22:55	PublicWiFi	let the teacher zoom teach and have a young teacher's aide stand in
2020-08-26 19:22:58	PublicWiFi	i thought it was a decent idea
2020-08-26 19:23:15	Fritzwastaken	Lets just get rid of schools!
2020-08-26 19:23:18	+s-d	<f​elda> the schools and states aren't letting them do that tho
2020-08-26 19:23:22	PublicWiFi	down with pubklic school!
2020-08-26 19:23:41	+s-d	<f​elda> In Texas if you are a teacher and you strike you instantly lose your job and your pension
2020-08-26 19:23:42	PublicWiFi	yeah im just saying the lock down can't go forever and there's a bunch of different ways of working out it
2020-08-26 19:23:46	+AnonymooseReddtr	misspwn yeah - our daycare is simialr.  10 kids i think
2020-08-26 19:23:51	+AnonymooseReddtr	don't change rooms, 
2020-08-26 19:24:12	+s-d	<f​elda> The lockdown will go on for as long as it takes

2020-08-26 19:24:16	+s-d	<G​ene> Does your car have airbags?
2020-08-26 19:24:29	PublicWiFi	I do wear one, because I look out for my own safety
2020-08-26 19:24:38	+s-d	<G​ene> your chances of dying this year from a car crash is much lower than .03%
2020-08-26 19:24:39	PublicWiFi	i do not agree with forced seatbeat laws though
2020-08-26 19:24:40	Fritzwastaken	Greedy bastard...
2020-08-26 19:24:50	+s-d	<f​elda> Dorks get all worried about "What's our endgame with COVID?!" Like the government wants to keep people alive for some nefarious reason. hmm maybe not dying is cool.
2020-08-26 19:24:59	PublicWiFi	this is where you bootlickers all lose the focus lol
2020-08-26 19:25:06	PublicWiFi	mask wearing? perfectly fine
2020-08-26 19:25:12	+s-d	<O​ddyKnocky> you know that not wearing a seatbelt can kill other people in your car, right?
2020-08-26 19:25:16	PublicWiFi	forced mask wearing? insane
2020-08-26 19:25:20	+s-d	<O​ddyKnocky> or someone not wearing one could kill you
2020-08-26 19:25:29	+s-d	<O​ddyKnocky> inertia is a helluva thing
2020-08-26 19:25:40	+s-d	<f​elda> If you look at the 1918 pandemic, countries that tried to stay open and get herd immunity by just letting the Beyblade rip came out worse on the other end economically.
2020-08-26 19:25:57	misspwn	i don't think it was insane to have work mandate it
2020-08-26 19:26:11	PublicWiFi	thats private entities though

2020-08-26 19:26:24	PublicWiFi	government mandated masks is a slippery slope
2020-08-26 19:26:37	+s-d	<G​ene> It's amazing how fucked up "individual liberties" has gotten thanks to the right-wing koolaid. Convincing people that "govt making you wear a mask" is a violation of liberties. However, they ignore the ability of being able to go to a public place without the underlying assumption of being infected with a disease.
2020-08-26 19:26:44	Fritzwastaken	But mah rights!
2020-08-26 19:26:50	+s-d	<G​ene> These people are stupid.
2020-08-26 19:26:53	+s-d	<O​ddyKnocky> we've already mandated them in the past and we've seen no issues with a "slippery slope" in that regard
2020-08-26 19:27:00	PublicWiFi	im saying being repsonsible because you care abot other people and your own safety. But having a government force you to do it sets a horrible precedent
2020-08-26 19:27:08	+s-d	<f​elda> It absolutely is not a slipper slope lol
2020-08-26 19:27:20	+s-d	<G​ene> Just wait until these koolaid drinkers start applying their logic to taxation D:

2020-08-27 16:44:30	+s-d	<m​ikeasaurus> I have windows server that 2/2 drives died in a virtual disk, the os is on that drive. The raid 5 vd still shows in the bios but the os vd does not. I have 2 drives that have windows server already installed on that as raid 1, is it possible to put them in and create a new vd with the 2 new drives?
2020-08-27 16:45:34	+s-d	<H​otmess> raid 5 only has tolorence of 1 disk
2020-08-27 16:45:38	+s-d	<H​otmess> you lost the array
2020-08-27 16:45:42	+s-d	<m​ikeasaurus> The raid 5 is ok

2020-08-27 16:46:07	+s-d	<H​otmess> is it raid 5(1) ? or raid 5(2)
2020-08-27 16:46:19	+s-d	<m​ikeasaurus> None of the drives in the raid 5 died, but in the raid 1 os vd
2020-08-27 16:46:40	+s-d	<m​ikeasaurus> So vd 0 (raid 5)is good, but vd1 (raid 1) is dead
2020-08-27 16:46:48	+s-d	<H​otmess> as long as one raid 1 drive is fine you should be fine to rebuild
2020-08-27 16:46:59	+s-d	<m​ikeasaurus> They are both dead
2020-08-27 16:47:23	+s-d	<m​ikeasaurus> We had a power outage and both drives show as failure

2020-08-27 16:48:31	+s-d	<m​ikeasaurus> Even if the os is on them?
2020-08-27 16:49:04	+s-d	<m​ikeasaurus> On the 2 new drives *
2020-08-27 16:49:13	+s-d	<A​cen> so you have 2 drives from another raid 1 array that had windows already installed on them?
2020-08-27 16:49:16	+s-d	<m​ikeasaurus> Yes
2020-08-27 16:49:30	+s-d	<A​cen> its probably not gonna work as its a different raid controller
2020-08-27 16:49:48	+s-d	<H​otmess> and diff windows enviroment
2020-08-27 16:49:50	+s-d	<m​ikeasaurus> Same server model, but ya different physical raid controller
2020-08-27 16:49:57	+s-d	<A​cen> yeah thats the issue

2020-08-27 16:50:05	+s-d	<H​otmess> as windows customizes itself when it installs
2020-08-27 16:50:22	+s-d	<H​otmess> creats all sorts of uniqe idenitifers
2020-08-27 16:50:38	+s-d	<A​cen> you could try
2020-08-27 16:50:40	+s-d	<H​otmess> i mean mabey if you get it to boot you can reset it to first boot experiance
2020-08-27 16:50:52	+s-d	<A​cen> but the chances of it working are low
2020-08-27 16:50:54	+s-d	<H​otmess> but its easier to just install again imo
2020-08-27 16:51:14	+s-d	<H​otmess> win2019 insstalls and limitied setups take like 30min
2020-08-27 16:51:21	+s-d	<H​otmess> what was on it?
2020-08-27 16:51:29	+s-d	<m​ikeasaurus> When I put the 2 new drives in, I still only see the raid 5 vd, but i see the 2 new drives as foreign
2020-08-27 16:51:47	+s-d	<A​cen> nah plugging a windows drive into a new computer/server isnt such a big issue anymore since windows 10
2020-08-27 16:51:51	+s-d	<m​ikeasaurus> It just serves as a host to vms on the raid 5
2020-08-27 16:52:01	+s-d	<H​otmess> another day when ZFS could have saved the day:)
2020-08-27 16:52:01	+s-d	<A​cen> yeah the raid controller doesnt know the drives
2020-08-27 16:52:24	+s-d	<A​cen> you could create a new RAID 1 with them but that would wipe the discs
2020-08-27 16:52:28	+s-d	<m​ikeasaurus> Can I import and create a new vd without it whiping the image?
2020-08-27 16:52:35	+s-d	<A​cen> tbh
2020-08-27 16:52:36	+s-d	<A​cen> try
2020-08-27 16:52:41	+s-d	<A​cen> might work
2020-08-27 16:52:46	+s-d	<A​cen> probably wont tho tbh

2020-09-01 18:09:08	JollyRgrs	While a full-size convection oven and an air fryer both use a fan to move hot air around, an air fryer circulates the air more rapidly inside a small chamber, speeding up the cooking process. Air fryers also employ a basket to more evenly circulate hot air around the bottom of your food.

2020-09-01 18:10:11	JollyRgrs	and the air fryer is meant to have more air circulation on 100% of the product (meaning also the bottom), and smaller space with a more powerful fan

2020-09-02 12:16:35	Hunterkll	you using WHV right
2020-09-02 12:16:41	xe0n	so it doesnt use the engine
2020-09-02 12:16:50	xe0n	the change is for the VVM or whatever they call it for vmware
2020-09-02 12:16:53	xe0n	it was changed how it runs
2020-09-02 12:16:56	xe0n	so it can co-exist with hyper-v
2020-09-02 12:17:08	Hunterkll	huh, i remember them saying it would use WHV 
2020-09-02 12:17:11	xe0n	but yes those extensions are installed
2020-09-02 12:17:33	xe0n	To fix this Hyper-V/Host VBS compatibility issue, VMware’s platform team re-architected VMware’s Hypervisor to use Microsoft’s WHP APIs. This means changing our VMM to run at user level instead of in privileged mode, as well modifying it to use the WHP APIs to manage the execution of a guest instead of using the underlying hardware directly.
2020-09-02 12:17:50	xe0n	VMware Workstation/Player can now run when Hyper-V is enabled. You no longer have to choose between running VMware Workstation and Windows features like WSL, Device Guard and Credential Guard. When Hyper-V is enabled, ULM mode will automatically be used so you can run VMware Workstation normally. If you don’t use Hyper-V at all, VMware Workstation is smart enough to detect this and 
2020-09-02 12:17:50	xe0n	the VMM will be used.
2020-09-02 12:18:07	Hunterkll	it literally says it's using WHP/WHV
2020-09-02 12:18:18	xe0n	right
2020-09-02 12:18:19	xe0n	well
2020-09-02 12:18:19	Hunterkll	 as well modifying it to use the WHP APIs to manage the execution of a guest instead of using the underlying hardware directly.
2020-09-02 12:18:22	Hunterkll	same shit as virtualbox
2020-09-02 12:18:26	xe0n	ohr ight

2020-09-02 13:23:35	Hunterkll	so use the 15-20 for gear only
2020-09-02 13:23:36	yuken	catbeard, I'm going to be either getting a 10mm carbine, or a stripped down SBR AR-15 for this
2020-09-02 13:23:40	yuken	to minimize weight.
2020-09-02 13:23:52	Hunterkll	yuken, properly distributed, the weight isn't much

Sadly we're already invested in other CAD solutions (for product design and development) that don't handle room-scale and larger particularly well when it comes to 2D plans. So there's no chance we're going to get a license just for me to do floorplans.

2020-09-02 16:52:27	Jekotia	Zero: I use a weechat relay and connect via Glowingbear
2020-09-02 16:52:37	Fritzwastaken	Some are weechat, some are mIRC, I used Hexchat
2020-09-02 16:53:06	Jekotia	Fritzwastaken: Okay. Your initial statement made it sound like launching IE made two other applications launch and tell you off for using IE xD
2020-09-02 16:53:14	Fritzwastaken	Oh no, not that bad
2020-09-02 16:53:18	Fritzwastaken	I just dont launch IE very often

2020-09-02 16:54:45	Jekotia	McDonaldsWiFi: You just called everyone in the Discord a bad person then, as they are technically using a different client.
2020-09-02 16:54:59	McDonaldsWiFi	Jekotia: am i wrong though? ;P

2020-09-02 17:01:32	+s-d	<b​rickwyde> Hey.  My org's infra doesn't really make use of modern solutions.   It's mostly manually provisioned, manually configured, manually supported servers/apps with automation existing primarily in integrations.  I'm trying to understand deployment at scale with the pets vs cattle mentality and how new solutions align with IaC.  Kubernetes and Ansible are large in that space - but does Ansible Tower do what Kubernees does?
2020-09-02 17:01:36	Nightcinder	anything i set in logitech options keeps for a bit, then changes, then if i open options again it works again, for a bit
2020-09-02 17:02:04	corona266	oh bb virsh is nice when you don't have the bandwidth for virt-manager
2020-09-02 17:02:17	Jekotia	And apparently visio has forgotten how numbers work. It's ordering pages alphebetically, and the order is basically XXXXX 1, XXXXX 6, XXXXX 2...
2020-09-02 17:02:20	+s-d	<r​mg22893> Kubernetes and Ansible are two different things @brickwyde
2020-09-02 17:02:31	+s-d	<r​mg22893> Kubernetes is container orchestration, Ansible is configuration management
2020-09-02 17:02:59	+s-d	<Z​ero> can you run weechat in putty lol
2020-09-02 17:03:12	+s-d	<r​mg22893> Ansible Tower doesn't have anywhere near a similar feature set as K8S to my knowledge
2020-09-02 17:03:14	+s-d	<D​iCeR> Putty is an app. It dont run other apps.
2020-09-02 17:03:25	+s-d	<Z​ero> well meaning ssh into something then running weechat
2020-09-02 17:03:38	humpaxx	yes
2020-09-02 17:03:52	+s-d	<D​iCeR> Then you know as well as others; That depends where you SSH in to...
2020-09-02 17:03:57	+s-d	<Z​ero> haha
2020-09-02 17:04:01	Jekotia	brickwyde: If you're familiar with Docker, think of Kubernetes as Docker but the configurations are much more complex and tell it how to scale up/down, what nodes to utilise, and generally how to distribute itself across a network.
2020-09-02 17:04:03	+s-d	<b​rickwyde> So Ansible tower's integrations with OpenShift - OpenShift would be the kubernetes alternative in that space?
2020-09-02 17:04:25	humpaxx	I run ZNC on a VPS, it also runs weechat (in a tmux session) connected to the ZNC server
2020-09-02 17:04:29	Fritzwastaken	Hello to you too @brickwyde
2020-09-02 17:04:43	humpaxx	So i can connect to the VPS and check what JollyRgrs types from anywhere in the world 
2020-09-02 17:04:44	Fritzwastaken	Comin in here just askin questions, not even sayin hi
2020-09-02 17:04:49	humpaxx	Gamewhanger
2020-09-02 17:05:02	jelly	brickwyde, OpenShift is k8s + docker + some custom RH routing and UI
2020-09-02 17:05:02	+s-d	<r​mg22893> openshift is basically just Red Hat flavored Kubernetes
2020-09-02 17:05:08	+s-d	<b​rickwyde> I did say hey.
2020-09-02 17:05:16	corona266	what's goin oon
2020-09-02 17:05:43	humpaxx	Great now i got that song stuck in my head.
2020-09-02 17:05:58	+s-d	<b​rickwyde> So k8s is still the standard for container orchestration, or are there growing alts in that space?
2020-09-02 17:06:14	JollyRgrs	humpaxx: we always tell people not to ask to ask... at that point, even saying "hi" is ancillary
2020-09-02 17:06:28	corona266	good morning JollyRgrs 
2020-09-02 17:06:55	corona266	may i inquire about a technology related subject?

2020-09-02 17:16:55	Jekotia	And I just realised I phrased that poorly. I meant installed OS, since for all I know you're booting into a live CD/USB.

2020-09-02 17:18:18	McDonaldsWiFi	wouldn't hurt to do a check
2020-09-02 17:18:21	Jekotia	If you want command line, look into smartctl; I'm not familiar with the CLI tool. I do know that a bad sector will stop dd in its tracks, but I'm not sure if it produces the same error you encountered.
2020-09-02 17:18:51	JollyRgrs	isn't there some args for dd to skip if it runs into a bad sector?
2020-09-02 17:18:53	nrb	do i have to do this in live cd?
2020-09-02 17:19:09	Xphacter	you should never have to live in a live cd
2020-09-02 17:19:13	Jekotia	nrb: You can do it on the live CD or the installed os

2020-09-02 17:19:31	JollyRgrs	pls use knoppix kthx
2020-09-02 17:20:20	Jekotia	nrb: smartctl -a /dev/sda, replacing sda with your actual drive, will list all of the smart stats

2020-09-02 17:20:54	Jekotia	I always use a GUI though since IDFK how to intrepret any of the values.
2020-09-02 17:21:37	Jekotia	Yea, get to a new drive first. Worry about the resizing later. Either way you need to clone the disk, may as well get to safety first.
2020-09-02 17:21:49	nrb	new drive needed?
2020-09-02 17:21:50	nrb	oof
2020-09-02 17:22:24	JollyRgrs	if you have uncorrectables....
2020-09-02 17:22:36	Jekotia	I wouldn't say strictly needed, but once you start seeing bad sectors it's generally a matter of time. Bad sectors usually indicate physical damage to the surface of the drive platters.
2020-09-02 17:22:49	JollyRgrs	i mean, even if they are "correctable"... pretty much any SMART error, even if able to run, is a red flag to replace the drive ASAP b/c more will come
2020-09-02 17:22:52	nrb	but is this a sector issue?
2020-09-02 17:23:13	Jekotia	You tell us. We can't see the readout.
2020-09-02 17:23:28	+s-d	<c​orona266> Dont they make back software that can work around bad sectors?
2020-09-02 17:23:49	Jekotia	corona266: they do, but it doesn't always work. Depends on the extent of the 'damage'.
2020-09-02 17:24:33	Jekotia	I was trying to clone a drive the other day and nothing would properly cope with the number of errors. Everything eventually died partway through the job.
2020-09-02 17:24:51	Jekotia	Hell, one attempt yielded a clone with a larger amount of used drive space than the source drive.

2020-09-02 17:26:27	+s-d	<A​lexis 🐼> Ah. I never had an issue with Macrium Reflect. When it asks for your email just go straight to the download button and don't bother filling it in
2020-09-02 17:26:36	Jekotia	Just did a straight up copy+paste of the necessary directories.

2020-09-02 17:31:48	Jekotia	Alexis: I don't know, I didn't get that impression. Seemed to me like he just wanted to get a complete picture of the problem so that he could determine how to proceed cloning wise.
2020-09-02 17:32:07	McDonaldsWiFi	yeah i think you're right
2020-09-02 17:32:16	McDonaldsWiFi	i think he shoulda just told dd to skip bad sectors and keep chuggin

2020-09-02 18:04:29	JollyRgrs	it might have started outside of IRC and just crept in
2020-09-02 18:04:29	Fritzwastaken	You keep logs of irc?
2020-09-02 18:04:29	SysAdminGoneCraZ	JollyRgrs, YOu have logs going that far back?!

2020-09-02 18:05:06	a1	pretty much all the clients i've ever used log by default
2020-09-02 18:05:19	JollyRgrs	SysAdminGoneCraZ: i had to finally trim my logs b/c it was so big of a file, too hard to grep
2020-09-02 18:05:20	corona266	the spoon tells me it may have not been for a cassarole
2020-09-02 18:05:31	JollyRgrs	and yeah, it logged by default, i just didn't change it
2020-09-02 18:05:45	a1	apparently i only have a year's worth of logs, pretty sure that's when i rebuilt this vps
2020-09-02 18:05:59	JollyRgrs	dude... what the actual garbage is that?
2020-09-02 18:06:10	JollyRgrs	what made you thik "i should put onion slices in milk"?
2020-09-02 18:06:22	a1	it's corona idk what you expect
2020-09-02 18:06:27	corona266	lmao, i can post the pickles in milk picture as well
2020-09-02 18:06:53	McDonaldsWiFi	all of my wiki documentation articles say somethign like "quick brain dump for now" or "some notes, need to flesh out more later"
2020-09-02 18:06:58	JollyRgrs	i HATE pickles
2020-09-02 18:07:04	@c1	always lurking
2020-09-02 18:07:08	McDonaldsWiFi	D:
2020-09-02 18:07:09	SysAdminGoneCraZ	corona266, Good lord lol
2020-09-02 18:07:53	SysAdminGoneCraZ	JollyRgrs, Is it a taste or texture thing with the pickles?
2020-09-02 18:08:13	corona266	he just doesn't wanna look gay by deep throating them
2020-09-02 18:08:42	JollyRgrs	maybe a bit of both?
2020-09-02 18:08:44	JollyRgrs	but def. taste
2020-09-02 18:09:08	SysAdminGoneCraZ	I can't do mushrooms for the texture. Feels like slime to me.
2020-09-02 18:09:15	JollyRgrs	like if i get a burger/etc with no pickles, and they just pull it off the sammich, i can taste it and i hate it
2020-09-02 18:09:16	SysAdminGoneCraZ	Taste is alright. 
2020-09-02 18:09:27	SysAdminGoneCraZ	Wife is the same way

2020-09-02 18:09:37	DomLS3	I have logs from back to 2018
2020-09-02 18:09:38	corona266	sounds like you don't like vinegar
2020-09-02 18:09:41	JollyRgrs	SysAdminGoneCraZ: there's more than one way to cook mushrooms... you might like them another way
2020-09-02 18:09:53	JollyRgrs	tbh, sliced baby bella mushrooms (raw) aren't bad at all on a salad
2020-09-02 18:10:04	JollyRgrs	i'm with you though, when they get slimey, i'm not a fan at all
2020-09-02 18:10:11	SysAdminGoneCraZ	JollyRgrs, I don't think I've tried them on a salad. I might give that a go
2020-09-02 18:10:11	JollyRgrs	corona266: i don't
2020-09-02 18:10:20	Fritzwastaken	JollyRgrs, I stopped logging cause someone had a exit quote that triggered my AV and my boss was like wtf is this
2020-09-02 18:10:23	JollyRgrs	but i can "cope" with like... salt+vinegar chips if i have to
2020-09-02 18:10:33	JollyRgrs	but the vinegar is def. the main issue
2020-09-02 18:10:40	DomLS3	Fritzwastaken: wait you were running irc on your work computer?
2020-09-02 18:10:45	JollyRgrs	Fritzwastaken: lol i remember someone doing that before

2020-09-02 18:17:48	DomLS3	@felda soooo were you ever diagnoised with diabeetus?
2020-09-02 18:17:56	+s-d	<f​elda> When I was first diagnosed 7 years ago my A1c was 11.5
2020-09-02 18:18:00	+s-d	<f​elda> Oh yeah
2020-09-02 18:18:02	Fritzwastaken	Ooof
2020-09-02 18:18:04	+s-d	<f​elda> I was amazingly diabetic
2020-09-02 18:18:07	+s-d	<f​elda> twice the normal limit
2020-09-02 18:18:10	JollyRgrs	amazingly... lol
2020-09-02 18:18:16	DomLS3	I didn't know it could be cured or ogo away on it's own
2020-09-02 18:18:20	DomLS3	I thought once you had it... you had it forever
2020-09-02 18:18:22	Fritzwastaken	Its a lot of work

2020-09-02 18:18:52	+s-d	<f​elda> should I fall back into drinking sodas and shit my body would very easily become insulin resistant again
2020-09-02 18:19:02	+s-d	<f​elda> I've essentially made it dormant
2020-09-02 18:19:07	DomLS3	nice
2020-09-02 18:19:13	DomLS3	so you don't have to take insulin now?
2020-09-02 18:19:17	+s-d	<f​elda> nope
2020-09-02 18:19:19	+s-d	<f​elda> I never did
2020-09-02 18:19:28	+s-d	<f​elda> I went the hardcore route and did it all without insulin
2020-09-02 18:19:42	+s-d	<f​elda> exercise and diet change

2020-09-02 18:20:27	Fritzwastaken	Im about to get my bike fixed up and bike in the morning
2020-09-02 18:20:37	Fritzwastaken	I wake up super early and think it would be fun
2020-09-02 18:20:37	DomLS3	fuck biking in the morning.
2020-09-02 18:20:42	DomLS3	or anything in the morning

2020-09-02 18:20:58	+s-d	<f​elda> I was diagnosed at 20 years old
2020-09-02 18:20:58	+s-d	<f​elda> I'm 28 now
2020-09-02 18:21:07	DomLS3	damn. nice
2020-09-02 18:21:11	d1	congrats felda 
2020-09-02 18:21:15	d1	proud of you bb
2020-09-02 18:21:16	Fritzwastaken	Nice, I was diagnosed prediabetic when I was 18
2020-09-02 18:21:16	+s-d	<f​elda> thankies
2020-09-02 18:21:20	Fritzwastaken	Its scary
2020-09-02 18:21:33	Fritzwastaken	Luckily a few lifestyle changes were all it took
2020-09-02 18:21:41	a1	nice man that's a big change
2020-09-02 18:21:51	Fritzwastaken	Bet you feel a ton better dont ya @felda| 
2020-09-02 18:21:55	+s-d	<f​elda> the easiest way for me to manage my diet was to use an app to do intermittent fasting. I stop eating at 8pm and start eating at 11am or noon. Makes it much easier to control your appetite.
2020-09-02 18:22:04	+s-d	<f​elda> Yeah I feel the strongest I ever have been
2020-09-02 18:22:18	DomLS3	@felda I do 24 hour fasting every day
2020-09-02 18:22:25	+s-d	<f​elda> because diabetes fucks up insulin you grow weak because insulin also transports proteins into muscles
2020-09-02 18:22:30	DomLS3	I eat at about 6:00pm and don't eat again until 6:00pm the next day
2020-09-02 18:22:37	DomLS3	so its technically 24 hour fasting every day
2020-09-02 18:22:38	+s-d	<f​elda> how many days a week?
2020-09-02 18:22:43	DomLS3	every days of the week
2020-09-02 18:22:43	+s-d	<f​elda> 24/7?
2020-09-02 18:22:43	DomLS3	lol
2020-09-02 18:22:46	+s-d	<f​elda> lol
2020-09-02 18:23:07	DomLS3	weekends I'll maybe have more than 1 meal but for the most part it's every day
2020-09-02 18:23:32	DomLS3	I'm cutting right now so once I finish this cycle I'll start on a bulk again
2020-09-02 18:23:36	DomLS3	and eat everything in sight
2020-09-02 18:23:46	+s-d	<f​elda> Damn you're braver than I
2020-09-02 18:23:46	Fritzwastaken	DomLS3, smokes 2 packs a day and drink 10 energy drinks though
2020-09-02 18:23:51	+s-d	<f​elda> I don't think I could ever do a cut
2020-09-02 18:24:02	DomLS3	Fritzwastaken: never smoked a day in my life and I hate energy drinks
2020-09-02 18:24:14	DomLS3	@felda - this is an extreme cut. Most don't do it
2020-09-02 18:24:22	DomLS3	It's 1200 cals or less a day. Often less
2020-09-02 18:25:11	+s-d	<f​elda> I was doing that last week.
2020-09-02 18:25:22	+s-d	<f​elda> I was so backed up that eating a can of soup would make me feel full
2020-09-02 18:25:42	+s-d	<f​elda> Sitting on the toilet begging to shit
2020-09-02 18:25:52	+s-d	<f​elda> And my body would whisper back no
2020-09-02 18:25:58	DomLS3	heh

2020-09-02 18:26:37	+s-d	<f​elda> the only thing that worked was Magnesium Citrate
2020-09-02 18:26:44	DomLS3	was just about to suggest that
2020-09-02 18:26:49	DomLS3	that shit is no joke

2020-09-03 22:13:50	meichthys	I see AppLocker has cmdlets that do what i want, but we have Windows 10 pro machines that don't support AppLocker 
2020-09-03 22:14:25	meichthys	int0x1C8 do you know if there's a way to create a new hash rule policy via poershell?
2020-09-03 22:14:35	meichthys	(since i can't modify)
2020-09-03 22:15:35	int0x1C8	I need to lookup what a hash rule is, sec

2020-09-03 22:16:29	int0x1C8	yeah reading it now
2020-09-03 22:17:59	catbeard	it's a sha256 of the binary, better to block by code signing certificate though i would think
2020-09-03 22:18:27	catbeard	a minute of googling suggests that you can't remotely add it via PS, you'd have to apply it locally and import registry keys?
2020-09-03 22:19:56	catbeard	i'm not a windowlicker admin though
2020-09-03 22:20:25	meichthys	catbeard, that's kinda what i'm seeing as well.
2020-09-03 22:20:43	int0x1C8	why can't you use RSAT?
2020-09-03 22:20:59	catbeard	you could also use Loki to conduct startup scans
2020-09-03 22:21:20	meichthys	int0x1C8 could you elaborate? I"m not sure how that would help.
2020-09-03 22:22:19	int0x1C8	the GPO management GUI snap-in is part of RSAT
2020-09-03 22:22:35	meichthys	yeah, it's no problem through the gui
2020-09-03 22:22:56	meichthys	but we have internal programs that are updated regularly so i'd like to automate the update of the file hash
2020-09-03 22:23:22	meichthys	it gets pretty old drilling down to the hash rule to update the programs each time!

2020-09-03 22:24:38	int0x1C8	create a GPO for each rule, and do whatever you need to make it only apply to the computers it needs to
2020-09-03 22:24:51	int0x1C8	then you only have to edit 1 setting in a GPO when it changes

2020-09-03 22:30:11	meichthys	I think i'll look into code signing my internal programs 
2020-09-03 22:30:19	meichthys	then i can just use a single cert rule in gpo
2020-09-03 22:30:23	meichthys	:P

2020-09-04 00:41:34	+s-d	<M​rMister> We have an employee who we believe erased incriminating files off a usb drive, we have no way of knowing what computer they used. Is there a way, past just normal data recovery, to see when it was wiper or by who?

2020-09-04 00:41:56	+s-d	<H​otmess> yup
2020-09-04 00:42:08	+s-d	<H​otmess> event log will record when a usb is connected and by which logged in use
2020-09-04 00:42:29	+s-d	<H​otmess> https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-track-down-usb-flash-drive-usage-in-windows-10s-event-viewer/
2020-09-04 00:42:30	PublicWiFi	but from the usb itself? prolly not
2020-09-04 00:42:42	PublicWiFi	but the logs would have had to have been enabled prior righht?
2020-09-04 00:42:45	+s-d	<H​otmess> i mean file deletion is usally recorded
2020-09-04 00:42:50	PublicWiFi	ah
2020-09-04 00:42:55	+s-d	<H​otmess> well depends if they buffer has looped
2020-09-04 00:43:07	+s-d	<H​otmess> usb being connected is actualy something that gets logged by default
2020-09-04 00:43:13	+s-d	<H​otmess> cause it needs to get drivers for it

2020-09-04 00:43:59	+s-d	<H​otmess> the issue is you need to be collecting the logs somewhere
2020-09-04 00:44:03	+s-d	<H​otmess> before the buffer loops
2020-09-04 00:45:59	+s-d	<M​rMister> But that would require  knowing which computer it was correct?
2020-09-04 00:46:18	+s-d	<M​rMister> @Hotness
2020-09-04 00:46:36	+s-d	<H​otmess> i mean it should be a peace fo piss to see where they logged in
2020-09-04 00:46:44	+s-d	<H​otmess> you should be logging that crap
2020-09-04 00:46:46	+s-d	<H​otmess> if you own the machine
2020-09-04 00:46:56	+s-d	<M​rMister> That's true, they're all logged in the domain
2020-09-04 00:46:57	+s-d	<H​otmess> beyond that contact a forensice firm
2020-09-04 00:47:07	+s-d	<M​rMister> As long as they didnt do it on a personal laptop
2020-09-04 00:47:11	+s-d	<M​rMister> Tha is for the help!
2020-09-04 00:47:16	+s-d	<H​otmess> gonna point out they might ahve done it with another username
2020-09-04 00:47:23	+s-d	<H​otmess> IE apprently records intresting things

2020-09-04 12:51:02	macinsight	We're a critical environment (Basically: People might die if our network fucks itself), so we need stability etc etc...
2020-09-04 12:51:18	macinsight	(Which in turn means no time for patching, but this is a different matter entirely)

2020-09-04 12:52:19	Aoyagi_raventop	Someone else suggested running  DISM.exe /Online/Cleanup-image/Restorehealth , can that potentially break something?
2020-09-04 12:53:29	macinsight	For the one throwing the issue, 2. We've got a bi-directional NAT running between our network and that of a step-company for a project.
2020-09-04 12:54:03	catbeard	macinsight: elaborate? why is bi-NAT needed
2020-09-04 12:54:25	catbeard	why not just separately firewalled subnet
2020-09-04 12:54:42	macinsight	catbeard: I wasn't the one making that recommendation, that was the net-eng team at the step company...
2020-09-04 12:55:02	catbeard	sounds like you need to slap someone like a redheaded step-company

2020-09-07 15:45:30	<--	agent_white (~agent_whi@unaffiliated/agent-white/x-6197888) has quit (Quit: later)
2020-09-07 15:46:40	rpifan	xe0n, im trying to get the special drs permission to take special medical lave
2020-09-07 15:46:42	rpifan	leave
2020-09-07 15:46:44	rpifan	to my fathers death
2020-09-07 15:46:51	rpifan	although my father would call me a lazy bastard
2020-09-07 15:46:56	rpifan	for sure i know him
2020-09-07 15:47:09	rpifan	vagonette he'd say, using me as an excuse to be lazy
2020-09-07 15:47:21	+s-d	<p​arseto> the important thing is that you want to be there for him
2020-09-07 15:47:31	+s-d	<p​arseto> not that you will or not be there 😉
2020-09-07 15:47:34	rpifan	well he is dead dont matter
2020-09-07 15:47:43	+xe0n	can't say i've heard people take six weeks off
2020-09-07 15:47:45	+xe0n	but ok
2020-09-07 15:47:54	rpifan	apparently its some kind of special dr thing
2020-09-07 15:47:59	rpifan	so i need to get the dr to approve it
2020-09-07 15:48:03	rpifan	but my hiv dr knows me 
2020-09-07 15:48:06	+xe0n	you've been wanting time off for the entire time you're there
2020-09-07 15:48:07	+xe0n	so lol
2020-09-07 15:48:09	rpifan	ive been his patient almost 2 years now
2020-09-07 15:48:16	+xe0n	get the note
2020-09-07 15:48:19	+xe0n	take 10 weeks off :D
2020-09-07 15:48:21	rpifan	well yes and thats why my dead would call my shit 
2020-09-07 15:48:24	+xe0n	take time off until your job clears
2020-09-07 15:48:25	+xe0n	LOL
2020-09-07 15:48:25	rpifan	buttt
2020-09-07 15:48:30	rpifan	exactly
2020-09-07 15:48:34	rpifan	thats the plan xe0n 
2020-09-07 15:48:36	+xe0n	LOL
2020-09-07 15:48:37	rpifan	its all strategic
2020-09-07 15:48:40	rpifan	ive been it this long
2020-09-07 15:48:42	rpifan	im so close
2020-09-07 15:48:45	rpifan	but also
2020-09-07 15:48:51	rpifan	if i take 6 weeks for real 100 percent
2020-09-07 15:48:55	rpifan	the studio will crash and burn so hard
2020-09-07 15:49:00	rpifan	they will have to call me back 
2020-09-07 15:49:12	rpifan	at the end of the day much like my father said, things fall by their own weight
2020-09-07 15:49:20	rpifan	so leaving the shit to my current boss will be enough to make it c lear they need me
2020-09-07 15:49:30	rpifan	and might give them the impetus to finally throw him out
2020-09-07 15:49:32	+s-d	<p​arseto> nah, there is no such thing as unreplaceable employee
2020-09-07 15:49:45	fritzwastaken	...
2020-09-07 15:49:52	+s-d	<p​arseto> especially in times like those with covid around
2020-09-07 15:50:19	rpifan	well thats the point
2020-09-07 15:50:19	humpaxx	Can be a pita to replace tho 
2020-09-07 15:50:22	yuken	Hunterkll, hoyl shit, that MOLLE pack is 11lb alone.
2020-09-07 15:50:25	yuken	That's heavy as hell.
2020-09-07 15:51:04	rpifan	@parseto ideally theyd fire us both
2020-09-07 15:51:05	rpifan	thats the point
2020-09-07 15:51:13	rpifan	not to be spiteful but for the legit future of the job
2020-09-07 15:51:18	rpifan	there is no way my boss can do it
2020-09-07 15:51:22	rpifan	and to be fire they should fire me too
2020-09-07 15:51:24	rpifan	while their at it
2020-09-07 15:51:25	+xe0n	yes he can
2020-09-07 15:51:27	rpifan	start from zero
2020-09-07 15:51:29	+xe0n	he was there before you, and will be there after you
2020-09-07 15:51:35	+xe0n	so yeah, i wouldn't assume much lol
2020-09-07 15:51:46	corn266	xe0n
2020-09-07 15:51:52	corn266	give me your aussie energy
2020-09-07 15:51:58	corn266	it's getting cold
2020-09-07 15:52:06	+s-d	<p​arseto> idk man, I always automate everything and at the end of the day - If I'm not there, they will never notice 😄
2020-09-07 15:52:28	rpifan	yes but this tech support
2020-09-07 15:52:32	rpifan	someone needs to answer the user tickets
2020-09-07 15:52:38	+s-d	<p​arseto> it's wrong in some way, because this way they don't depend on me and can get rid of me at any point 😉
2020-09-07 15:52:39	corn266	"fuck off"
2020-09-07 15:52:45	corn266	is generally how i answer tickets
2020-09-07 15:52:52	corn266	because we don't have a ticketing system
2020-09-07 15:53:08	+s-d	<p​arseto> my way of thinking is - why there is a need for user tickets at first place
2020-09-07 15:53:36	+s-d	<p​arseto> aka - if there is a need for user tickets, this means that someone didn't done their work
2020-09-07 15:53:44	fritzwastaken	Burn
2020-09-07 15:53:46	corn266	idk
2020-09-07 15:53:55	rpifan	@parseto agreed
2020-09-07 15:53:58	rpifan	thats the whole point
2020-09-07 15:54:01	rpifan	but the boss cant do that
2020-09-07 15:54:01	corn266	mrs. ladybell may not remember her pw
2020-09-07 15:54:04	rpifan	he depends so heavily on me
2020-09-07 15:54:09	+xe0n	you think that...
2020-09-07 15:54:11	fritzwastaken	New user creations
2020-09-07 15:54:14	rpifan	but he does
2020-09-07 15:54:19	rpifan	his desperate calls 
2020-09-07 15:54:20	rpifan	and emails
2020-09-07 15:54:21	corn266	or mr. howdydoodle may not be able to log into his workstation 
2020-09-07 15:54:23	fritzwastaken	There are tons of things that cant be automated when it comes to users
2020-09-07 15:54:28	corn266	or the datacenter is literally on fire
2020-09-07 15:54:38	fritzwastaken	Backups are failing
2020-09-07 15:55:11	fritzwastaken	Well, nevermind, parseto did say "user tickets" 
2020-09-07 15:55:20	fritzwastaken	datacenter and backups wouldnt fall into that
2020-09-07 15:55:33	+s-d	<p​arseto> it doesn't matter what is the reason - wherever  there is no single fucking button that will make the user happy or a help bubble that will provide explanation in a way that even kids can understand
2020-09-07 15:55:51	rpifan	and this is the requirement of the job
2020-09-07 15:55:54	rpifan	not just for the users
2020-09-07 15:55:56	rpifan	but for my boss
2020-09-07 15:55:59	rpifan	the super 10 year sys admin
2020-09-07 15:56:08	rpifan	who doesnt even know how to prefix his user name wit hthe domain to log into a machine
2020-09-07 15:56:17	+s-d	<p​arseto> it's simple either shitty product, shitty process or shitty infra 😄
2020-09-07 15:56:19	rpifan	he spent 5 months trying to log into the new memeber server
2020-09-07 15:56:25	rpifan	and he kept saying i cant do it
2020-09-07 15:56:27	rpifan	i cant get in
2020-09-07 15:56:29	rpifan	whats wrong
2020-09-07 15:56:30	rpifan	fix it
2020-09-07 15:56:34	rpifan	and i kept talign to him
2020-09-07 15:56:41	rpifan	and i kept expaining that exact point
2020-09-07 15:56:50	+xe0n	yeah you could've shown him or done it in email
2020-09-07 15:56:51	+xe0n	who knows
2020-09-07 15:56:52	+xe0n	but whatever
2020-09-07 15:56:53	rpifan	until one day he calls me and he says oh let me try to do X, x was what i told him for 5 months
2020-09-07 15:57:00	+s-d	<p​arseto> your boss will not like this - but I guess that it's time to replace the boss 😄
2020-09-07 15:57:02	rpifan	and then oh it worked
2020-09-07 15:57:28	rpifan	we had a chat about stuff, i said can you please hlep me with the permissions on the synology box im not super good at it
2020-09-07 15:57:32	rpifan	if you have time can you look at the user manual
2020-09-07 15:57:36	+s-d	<p​arseto> either you can replace him or he can be replaced by someone else kekW
2020-09-07 15:57:36	rpifan	and he said yes yes
2020-09-07 15:57:38	rpifan	i wanna take care of this
2020-09-07 15:57:49	rpifan	he has been wantng to learn about the permissions 
2020-09-07 15:57:53	rpifan	and i said please take that role
2020-09-07 15:57:56	rpifan	and well he failed
2020-09-07 15:58:12	rpifan	and when i brought it up he said well i only read specific points and i said well the permissions work like in winodws
2020-09-07 15:58:14	rpifan	but he didnt listen
2020-09-07 15:58:24	+xe0n	"like in windows"
2020-09-07 15:58:25	rpifan	anyway yea replace him
2020-09-07 15:58:30	+xe0n	so you bought linux into the mix?
2020-09-07 15:58:36	+s-d	<p​arseto> well, fair enough, but simply just bragging about this will not solve your "problem"
2020-09-07 15:58:36	rpifan	its a synology box
2020-09-07 15:58:39	+xe0n	oh right
2020-09-07 15:58:39	+xe0n	lol
2020-09-07 15:58:45	rpifan	its a got a pretty
2020-09-07 15:58:46	rpifan	user manual
2020-09-07 15:58:50	rpifan	with lots of pictures and support
2020-09-07 15:58:51	rpifan	and shit
2020-09-07 15:59:01	rpifan	but even if he reads he doesnt understand or processs
2020-09-07 15:59:10	rpifan	@parseto its not bragging,i ve talked ot HR
2020-09-07 15:59:13	rpifan	and to the studio manager
2020-09-07 15:59:17	rpifan	hence why we had this meeting earlier
2020-09-07 15:59:19	rpifan	and he was a total ass
2020-09-07 15:59:38	+s-d	<p​arseto> nice 😄 I like spicy stories with continuation
2020-09-07 15:59:50	+s-d	<p​arseto> let us know who is getting fired 😄
2020-09-07 15:59:56	rpifan	maybe me 
2020-09-07 15:59:58	rpifan	or maybe him
2020-09-07 16:00:00	rpifan	or maybe both
2020-09-07 16:00:03	rpifan	or probably neither
2020-09-07 16:00:08	rpifan	they are stuck with us for the forseable future
2020-09-07 16:00:17	rpifan	because as the studio manager said, the process in this last year has been huge
2020-09-07 16:00:19	rpifan	ive seen the results
2020-09-07 16:00:24	rpifan	and who has been there this last year me
2020-09-07 16:00:38	rpifan	so he is admitting that have improved
2020-09-07 16:00:49	+s-d	<p​arseto> oh, that will be epic - "Hi boyz, sooooo, you know that it's corona time, sooooo.... you are both laid off"
2020-09-07 16:01:08	rpifan	he cant
2020-09-07 16:01:14	rpifan	becuase we are on kurzarebit
2020-09-07 16:01:21	rpifan	its a special german thing where you work less and get paid the same 
2020-09-07 16:01:45	rpifan	if its an opertional reason to throw us out it wuld have to be super specific
2020-09-07 16:01:53	+s-d	<p​arseto> god damn germens, man!
2020-09-07 16:01:59	rpifan	also they cant fire me just like that unless i destroy something on person or do something really awful
2020-09-07 16:02:03	rpifan	i need to first get a written note
2020-09-07 16:02:08	rpifan	and then give time to im,prove
2020-09-07 16:02:11	rpifan	and since ive not gotten any of that 
2020-09-07 16:02:13	+xe0n	jeez stop worrying and just do the fucking job
2020-09-07 16:02:15	rpifan	ive got a while to go still
2020-09-07 16:02:16	rpifan	i cant
2020-09-07 16:02:21	rpifan	he blocked my user accounts
2020-09-07 16:02:22	rpifan	lol
2020-09-07 16:02:28	+xe0n	great, nothing to worry about then
2020-09-07 16:02:32	+xe0n	enjoy the break
2020-09-07 16:02:33	rpifan	exactly
2020-09-07 16:02:53	rpifan	my official 6 week break i hope
2020-09-07 16:03:05	+s-d	<p​arseto> yea @rpifan , you seem like being pretty stressed about this situation
2020-09-07 16:03:07	rpifan	also yes id be a bit bored but ive been unemployed most of my life, its a great time to bake bread, study more german
2020-09-07 16:03:23	rpifan	ive been dealing with this situation for almot a year and ive got a dead father in chile to deal with 
2020-09-07 16:03:28	rpifan	and inheretance 
2020-09-07 16:03:30	rpifan	and land
2020-09-07 16:03:33	rpifan	and ic ant even go to the country
2020-09-07 16:03:47	+s-d	<p​arseto> well, guess what - you are not alone
2020-09-07 16:03:56	+s-d	<p​arseto> lots of ppl deal with the same shit 🙂
2020-09-07 16:04:48	rpifan	thats not helping lol
2020-09-07 16:05:01	+xe0n	rpifan, we're ALL dealing with some form of shit
2020-09-07 16:05:03	+xe0n	does that help?
2020-09-07 16:05:06	rpifan	nooo
2020-09-07 16:05:08	+xe0n	loll
2020-09-07 16:05:15	+s-d	<p​arseto> what I am saying is - you should be more positive about it
2020-09-07 16:05:17	rpifan	stop trying to help
2020-09-07 16:05:48	+s-d	<p​arseto> maybe if you get fired, you will be able to find a better job
2020-09-07 16:06:05	+s-d	<p​arseto> or maybe your boss will get fired and he will be replaced by a better person
2020-09-07 16:06:14	+s-d	<p​arseto> or maybe you will become the boss in that case
2020-09-07 16:06:28	+s-d	<p​arseto> (and you will have more responsibilities to deal with 😄 rofl)
2020-09-07 16:06:31	rpifan	i dont wanna be the boss
2020-09-07 16:06:57	+s-d	<p​arseto> well, I just saying that you should look at the bright side
2020-09-07 16:07:02	+s-d	<p​arseto> not only from the dark side
2020-09-07 16:07:09	rpifan	i am
2020-09-07 16:07:12	rpifan	but please
2020-09-07 16:07:16	rpifan	i need at least until november
2020-09-07 16:07:19	rpifan	tafter that 
2020-09-07 16:07:20	rpifan	the situation changes
2020-09-07 16:07:26	rpifan	so dont be helpful until then
2020-09-07 16:07:28	+s-d	<p​arseto> for example - your dad is dead, but did he suffer a lot, before that?
2020-09-07 16:07:42	+xe0n	ok enough about this
2020-09-07 16:07:46	+s-d	<p​arseto> I had relative that suffered from a very painful and slow death
2020-09-07 16:07:48	+xe0n	if you wanna know, pm him
2020-09-07 16:07:52	+xe0n	the channel doesn't need details of personal matters
2020-09-07 16:07:53	+xe0n	thanks :)
2020-09-07 16:08:10	+s-d	<p​arseto> he basically begged for us for eutanasia
2020-09-07 16:08:17	+xe0n	if rpifan is happy to discuss details with you, he can in a pm, but for the public chan, let's keep it a fun atmosphere :)
2020-09-07 16:08:22	rpifan	for once i agree with you xe0n 
2020-09-07 16:08:25	+s-d	<p​arseto> so, keep your head up and start living your life
2020-09-07 16:08:59	+s-d	<p​arseto> we have little time to spend on this planet, so better make it worth
2020-09-07 16:09:23	fritzwastaken	Hrm

2020-09-07 17:32:42	+s-d	<N​ick116> One other thing, I have microsoft remote desktop for controlling vms (wondows) but is there a version of that for linux?
2020-09-07 17:33:10	+s-d	<H​otmess> rdp?
2020-09-07 17:33:16	+s-d	<H​otmess> yeah but the linux one isnt as good
2020-09-07 17:33:23	+s-d	<H​otmess> install powershell core and you can use winrm instead
2020-09-07 17:33:32	+s-d	<N​ick116> I have a mac
2020-09-07 17:33:47	nobyk	@Hotmess Does that work?
2020-09-07 17:33:57	+s-d	<H​otmess> powershell core installes the winrm framework

2020-09-07 17:34:04	nobyk	I thought windows winrm and linux powershell/winrm wasn't the same
2020-09-07 17:34:15	+s-d	<H​otmess> so you can admin all your hosts on the same framework
2020-09-07 17:34:39	+s-d	<H​otmess> enter-pssession and invoke-command works fine

2020-09-07 17:36:34	nobyk	From linux I wanted to start a vm on a hyperv so I tried to invoke-command start-vm but didn't do it, kept getting auth errors
2020-09-07 17:36:36	+s-d	<H​otmess> that needs to be run on the linux hosts during the setup to allow incoming connections to the linux ps core host

These experts are consultants for customers and therefore consumers who choose among the many cloud alternatives in the market, for example; AWS, IBM, Google, Microsoft ETC ... If security is divided into two parts, the
2020-09-08 17:20:57	Avoltneimmarsa	first one who deals with the security of the physical cloud infrastructure then the supplier for example AMAZON WITH AWS, and the other is the architects of the cloud for the clients who assist, Those who are in charge of creating, designing, developing and planning cloud security of: IBM, AWS, ORACLE, Google, Microsoft ... What are the names of
2020-09-08 17:20:57	Avoltneimmarsa	those who deal with the security of the supplier's cloud infrastructure then engineers of these big companies? This is to be able to look for certifications, manuals and then specialize in this field Names of professional roles in the field of information technology and security thanks to everyone.

2020-09-08 17:46:53	@JollyRgrs	depending on the org, you might want to be able to distinguish between departments, for reporting, etc...
2020-09-08 17:46:56	+s-d	<r​mg22893> our MDT instance names the machines either DK or LP-SN to start with

2020-09-09 11:23:17	+s-d	<P​hoenix> Hello gents
2020-09-09 11:23:37	+s-d	<P​hoenix> I have a ws 2019 installed on a physical server running hyper-x
2020-09-09 11:23:50	+s-d	<P​hoenix> i want to install veeam b&r to backup the vms
2020-09-09 11:24:06	+s-d	<P​hoenix> so i understand i should install b&r in the physical server running ws 2019, correct?

2020-09-09 11:28:15	+s-d	<Q​werty> You can install it anywhere with access to backup storage
2020-09-09 11:28:39	nobyk	^
2020-09-09 11:28:41	+s-d	<Q​werty> Usually you don't install anything on a host
2020-09-09 11:29:00	+s-d	<Q​werty> But if your smb then it doesn't really matter
2020-09-09 11:29:34	+s-d	<P​hoenix> I have a ws 2019 installed on a physical server running hyper-v (edited)
2020-09-09 11:29:53	nobyk	Can install it on a VM, should be fine
2020-09-09 11:30:16	+s-d	<Q​werty> I want to start putting servers on dhcp reservations, we have failover dhcp and fairly long lease time. Is this a bad idea y/n
2020-09-09 11:30:22	nobyk	s/should/will
2020-09-09 11:30:23	l8	nobyk meant: "Can install it on a VM, will be fine"
2020-09-09 11:30:36	+s-d	<Q​werty> There's 2000 or so servers if it matters
2020-09-09 11:31:25	nobyk	I guess that depends how confident you are in your failover
2020-09-09 11:32:07	nobyk	How easy would it be to fix if it does break
2020-09-09 11:32:15	+s-d	<Q​werty> The chance of two clusters failing is about the same as any two important network devices failing I think
2020-09-09 11:33:27	+s-d	<Q​werty> It does add risk I don't think it outweighs the benefits of dynamic allocation for DNS and ip for new servers
2020-09-09 11:34:42	nobyk	How big is the hassle of configuring the IPs on the servers
2020-09-09 11:34:55	nobyk	would also factor in my descision I think
2020-09-09 11:36:28	+s-d	<Q​werty> For manually building a server? Not a lot, but if you want to deploy or put in a temporary DNS server.. More so
2020-09-09 11:38:33	nobyk	I wanted to try openstack but I don't think I meet the system requiremnts
2020-09-09 11:39:36	nobyk	it wants a recommended 24gb of ram, is that to have a bunch of stuff on it already or is that just for openstack without anything running on it
2020-09-09 11:39:56	+s-d	<Q​werty> We have an hp open stack cluster but looking at replacing it
2020-09-09 11:40:29	jelly	you'd typically deploy it on dedicated hardware, nobyk

2020-09-10 19:18:21	int0x1C8	the 29 has the same problem as the f-16: really short legs
2020-09-10 19:19:09	int0x1C8	by the time you take off, get to your staging/patrol point, and set up a pattern, you might only have 20 minutes of loiter time
2020-09-10 19:19:43	int0x1C8	you might also be thinking of negative-G flameouts
2020-09-10 19:20:46	int0x1C8	Russians tend to use jet engines that are at least partially dependent on positive G force for normal operation, meaning if you go inverted, or pull negative G's for more than like 10 seconds the engines flame out

2020-09-14 15:14:15	PipeItToDevNull	This channel actually gets mad at me for palming off stupid admins 
2020-09-14 15:14:22	xe0n	hahaha
2020-09-14 15:14:30	 *	Hunterkll shrugs
2020-09-14 15:14:36	Hunterkll	most of the time they just need a pointer what to read/look at 
2020-09-14 15:15:06	PipeItToDevNull	Same thing there, we dont want r/techsupport becoming some little r/sysadmin 
2020-09-14 15:15:14	Hunterkll	no i mean
2020-09-14 15:15:35	Hunterkll	instead of people going "go to ##techsupport not here" you'd go "eh that's not really how it works, here's a reference on the different types of firewalling to get you started"
2020-09-14 15:15:47	PipeItToDevNull	ah, coo
2020-09-14 15:15:58	Hunterkll	actually did just that a few days ago :P
2020-09-14 15:16:03	PipeItToDevNull	I do avoid sending the real stupid ones 
2020-09-14 15:16:06	Hunterkll	poor guy had no clue what he really was trying to do 
2020-09-14 15:16:24	PipeItToDevNull	that sums up most of them. Otherwise they would be in a much more specific sub 
2020-09-14 15:16:43	Hunterkll	"do i put it between the modem and router? replace the router? after the router? " 
2020-09-14 15:16:54	xe0n	lolll i remember him
2020-09-14 15:17:01	Hunterkll	so i gave him a few docs on transparent vs non-transparent firewalling and he chewedd on that and never came back
2020-09-14 15:17:02	Hunterkll	lol
2020-09-14 15:17:13	Hunterkll	poor guy was trying to teach himself firewall and network stuff
2020-09-14 15:17:21	Hunterkll	but had no idea where to get started lol
2020-09-14 15:17:23	xe0n	we told him to ping MikeSpears

2020-09-14 15:18:09	Hunterkll	instead of palming 'em off, give 'em something to chew on so they know how to ask the right questions 
2020-09-14 15:18:21	fritzwastaken	yo!
2020-09-14 15:18:28	Hunterkll	if you don't know the terminology, you'll just get stuck in a cycle of nothing
2020-09-14 15:18:43	xe0n	stuck in a cycle of clicking the im feeling lucky button the googles
2020-09-14 15:18:46	Hunterkll	and an entire channel saying "go to ##techsupport" when they had no clue :P
2020-09-14 15:19:04	jelly	to bake an apple pie, first you need to... invent the universe
2020-09-14 15:19:05	xe0n	the best one was the other day someone came in here asking about their monitor
2020-09-14 15:19:08	Hunterkll	PipeItToDevNull, suffice it to say, if he had gone to ##techsupport he would have ended up even far more confused 
2020-09-14 15:19:08	Hunterkll	lol
2020-09-14 15:19:21	PipeItToDevNull	=P
2020-09-14 15:19:23	xe0n	and they said they went to ##techsupport, but because it was a work monitor it was a sysadmin's job to resolve
2020-09-14 15:19:25	xe0n	i lol'd
2020-09-14 15:19:40	Hunterkll	i uh

2020-09-14 15:21:29	PipeItToDevNull	It is currently in testing with only ops. We are bridging a 'general' channel to ##techsupport
2020-09-14 15:21:32	xe0n	discord keeps resetting my audio settings every friday

2020-09-14 15:22:13	PipeItToDevNull	I am wary of discord and want to use ripcord, but those fucks will hijack your account and say 'I dunno, magical unicorn farts decided that'

2020-09-14 15:23:08	PipeItToDevNull	Our goal is to attract more helpers, and many many more people will use discord than IRC 
2020-09-14 15:23:11	Hunterkll	each chan is different enough it'd probably be a separate discord instance for each group 
2020-09-14 15:23:16	 *	Hunterkll shrugs

2020-09-14 16:32:03	Hunterkll	hmmm well, i recall in one office we could connect to VPN from inside the network...
2020-09-14 16:32:20	Hunterkll	no real point really, but the chinese office had to do that to access stuff
2020-09-14 16:32:36	PipeItToDevNull	They can connect to all VPNs from inside the office but my alwaysOn is heavily restricted so it broke what they could do in the office 
2020-09-14 16:32:49	PipeItToDevNull	I just set the metric on that to 350 so *every* other route is prefered, woo

2020-09-14 16:57:57	Hunterkll	no, they merged with level3 a few years ago

2020-09-15 21:19:08	rpifan	its a super expensive game
2020-09-15 21:19:11	rpifan	to just get a piece of shit rom

2020-09-15 21:19:13	+s-d	<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> That's an N64 Emulator, GC Emulator, and Wii Emulator that Nintendo is just handing to the dev community.
2020-09-15 21:19:14	Hunterkll	rpifan, why? It'll play just as good
2020-09-15 21:19:21	rpifan	its all about effort
2020-09-15 21:19:22	rpifan	and money
2020-09-15 21:19:30	Hunterkll	they probably developed the emulator just for it
2020-09-15 21:19:32	rpifan	why should i pay top dollar for us to get some roms and shit and glue it together
2020-09-15 21:19:35	Hunterkll	want it to be 100% original 
2020-09-15 21:19:40	Hunterkll	because that's not what you're getting
2020-09-15 21:19:41	rpifan	well it aint
2020-09-15 21:19:45	rpifan	its got new textures
2020-09-15 21:19:45	Hunterkll	and you're severely understating the complexity of it

2020-09-15 21:19:58	corona266	inb4 it turns out they're just running dolphine emulator on the switch
2020-09-15 21:20:05	Hunterkll	rpifan, then it's likely not pure emulation
2020-09-15 21:20:08	rpifan	they didnt go the extra mile
2020-09-15 21:20:10	rpifan	it is
2020-09-15 21:20:15	+s-d	<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> There's some other stuff they'd have to compensate for too. The GC had a pressure sensitive trigger, and you could use that in sunshine to spray water while running.
2020-09-15 21:20:15	rpifan	the dude just explained how it work
2020-09-15 21:20:25	rpifan	thye are so lazy
2020-09-15 21:20:32	rpifan	im gonna post angry youtube comments but sigh whats the point

2020-09-15 21:20:34	rpifan	so depressing
2020-09-15 21:20:37	Hunterkll	they put a shitload of work into making it work
2020-09-15 21:20:39	+s-d	<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> But since we don't have a pressure sensitive trigger on the switch, they'll have to think of something.
2020-09-15 21:20:41	Hunterkll	and you're like "they're lazy lol"
2020-09-15 21:21:10	Hunterkll	corona266, oh shit are we testing 450 again? ooooo
2020-09-15 21:21:19	rpifan	my switch is an 0g so its vulnerable but i ahvent modded it

2020-09-15 21:21:56	+s-d	<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> I modded mine. Lost internet, but gained so much more.

2020-09-15 21:24:47	Hunterkll	yea, you don't realize how complex stuff like this is
2020-09-15 21:24:50	Hunterkll	at all

2020-09-15 21:25:16	rpifan	dude
2020-09-15 21:25:22	rpifan	u can run a fucken emulator right now
2020-09-15 21:25:22	Hunterkll	rpifan, this is far more than just a simple emulator 
2020-09-15 21:25:24	rpifan	n the fucken switch
2020-09-15 21:25:29	rpifan	and u get the same god damn result
2020-09-15 21:25:32	Hunterkll	right, without any of the capabilities he's describing 
2020-09-15 21:25:33	rpifan	and for free
2020-09-15 21:25:38	rpifan	in fact the ppl who developed all of this shit
2020-09-15 21:25:42	rpifan	shold be getting 60 dollars a pop
2020-09-15 21:25:49	Hunterkll	what?
2020-09-15 21:25:58	Hunterkll	it's an internally developed emulator - no open source code or anything like that 
2020-09-15 21:25:59	rpifan	all the emulator devs and the ppl who ripped the roms to begin with
2020-09-15 21:26:11	rpifan	that doesnt mean it cant be clean room reverse enginners
2020-09-15 21:26:13	rpifan	or at the very least
2020-09-15 21:26:14	rpifan	inspired
2020-09-15 21:26:19	rpifan	by the open source work ppl ahve done
2020-09-15 21:26:21	Hunterkll	they don't have to reverse engineer it
2020-09-15 21:26:26	Hunterkll	they have all the code and specs

2020-09-15 21:26:37	Hunterkll	so they can do it better
2020-09-15 21:26:44	rpifan	but they arent doing it better
2020-09-15 21:26:52	rpifan	they are doing just like the current stuff out there
2020-09-15 21:26:53	Hunterkll	the realtime code patching alone
2020-09-15 21:26:57	Hunterkll	you *obviously* don't understand this
2020-09-15 21:27:21	Hunterkll	i mean, the rom isn't actually the full rom either, there's components missing 
2020-09-15 21:27:26	Hunterkll	according to the research i found here 
2020-09-15 21:27:30	corona266	wait
2020-09-15 21:27:45	Hunterkll	so there's a ton of new code/assets too, that aren't being emulated
2020-09-15 21:27:46	corona266	they removed the headphone jack, now they're removing the power adapter for the watch
2020-09-15 21:27:48	rpifan	yes but its a lot simpler and cheaper to emulate then to acutally bring it up to modern sepcs
2020-09-15 21:27:48	Hunterkll	it's like hybrid emulation 
2020-09-15 21:27:49	corona266	wtf
2020-09-15 21:27:50	rpifan	that the whole point

2020-09-15 21:28:21	Hunterkll	corona266, what?
2020-09-15 21:28:29	Hunterkll	corona266, what doy uo mean removing the power adapter, it charges the same way
2020-09-15 21:28:46	rpifan	apple is another piece of shit
2020-09-15 21:28:52	rpifan	but at least everyone knows they are shit
2020-09-15 21:28:54	corona266	they said they're removing the USB-C port I believe
2020-09-15 21:28:54	rpifan	so no surprise 
2020-09-15 21:29:02	corona266	maybe I heard that wrong
2020-09-15 21:29:08	Hunterkll	corona266, apple watch never had a usb-c port

2020-09-15 21:31:37	Hunterkll	rpifan, anyway, what nintendo did here potentially also opens up the entire GC catalog, which would be amazing 
2020-09-15 21:31:42	corona266	"this is crazy! the guy runs 20miles in 5 minutes!"
2020-09-15 21:31:50	Hunterkll	with the ability to replace parts of the games and run those parts non-emulated 
2020-09-15 21:31:58	Hunterkll	and wholesale replace assets and do realtime patching 
2020-09-15 21:32:03	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> ok i have an issue
2020-09-15 21:32:05	Hunterkll	that's a huge tech deal 
2020-09-15 21:32:23	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> because I live so far from the road I can't get cable. i've been using tmobile unlimited tethering
2020-09-15 21:32:24	Hunterkll	it also reduces the load cost of emulation so that it doesn't impact battery life doing hybrid  
2020-09-15 21:32:35	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> use to pay a lot of money, but now they took the plan away
2020-09-15 21:32:50	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> and I still need unlimited tethering, or i need to change service providers
2020-09-15 21:32:53	corona266	See if you can get a hookup at the road and install radio dishes
2020-09-15 21:33:17	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> if any plans have unlimited tethering, or is there a work around i can use?
2020-09-15 21:33:31	Hunterkll	not really, t-mobile's unlimited plans are still the most liberal 
2020-09-15 21:33:54	Hunterkll	pretty sure my plan still is unlimited like that
2020-09-15 21:34:13	Hunterkll	only time i ever got a throttle warning was when i downloaded like 90GB in a few hours because i left FFXV installer running on my laptop without realizing it when i went out of the house
2020-09-15 21:34:15	Hunterkll	:X
2020-09-15 21:34:26	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> I've never been throttled before. It seems I have unlimited on my phones, but not for tethering my computer

2020-09-15 21:34:56	Hunterkll	@BottlenekDolfin you can just get a hotspot / hotspot plan, after whatever your plan capacity it'll throttle you down to like 2mbit but still better than nothing i guess

2020-09-15 21:35:28	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> it was like International One + or something
2020-09-15 21:35:29	rpifan	thats all
2020-09-15 21:35:43	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> no the plan seems to be gone now. Now it's limited to 50gb 4g lte
2020-09-15 21:35:46	corona266	oh Hunterkll any good way to determine how FiOS would get connected in an apartment building? I don't think verizon has any equiment in the building
2020-09-15 21:35:57	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> they offer Tmobile Home Internet through LTE, but it's "not available"
2020-09-15 21:35:58	Hunterkll	rpifan, lol, everyone who understands what they did is like "woah that's pretty awsome" and yuo're like "BLAH" - if they ported it fully, it'd still look the same and then they would *still* have to do this work anyway

2020-09-15 21:36:40	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> I got one idea to change some settings on the phone, but the article says it shouldn't be abused too much. you can just go over your plan a little bit
2020-09-15 21:36:40	Hunterkll	"I'm standing outside your office with a gun"
2020-09-15 21:36:42	Hunterkll	i think that's the phrase 
2020-09-15 21:36:47	a1	"When cleaning up unused binaries and old logs on a CVM, it is important to note that all the user data partitions on each drive associated with a given node are also mounted within /home. This is why we strongly advise against using undocumented commands like “rm -rf /home”, since this will also wipe the user data directories mounted within this path. The purpose of this article is to
2020-09-15 21:36:50	a1	guide you through identifying the files that are causing the CVM to run low on free space and removing only those which can be safely deleted."

2020-09-15 21:37:59	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> idk if that would work
2020-09-15 21:38:18	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> that would "violate terms of service" but idk

2020-09-15 21:58:05	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> ok now T-mobile called and said they throttled because too many people were using the tower and I was one of the +50gb

2020-09-15 21:59:10	+s-d	<B​ottlenekDolfin> there was unlimited plans where after like 20 gb of data they switch you to 3g

2020-09-15 22:07:44	+s-d	<g​3r> or i need a dockerfile?
2020-09-15 22:07:44	corona266	don't you set that in the Dockerfile?
2020-09-15 22:08:01	+s-d	<g​3r> yeah i dont have a docker file :harold:
2020-09-15 22:08:02	Heresiarch	@g3r not how docker works - you'd need either a dockerfile and/or a docker-compose.yml to specify that stuff.
2020-09-15 22:08:05	corona266	oh wait
2020-09-15 22:08:12	corona266	no you set those in the docker-compose.yml
2020-09-15 22:08:13	+s-d	<g​3r> i shud have thought about that

2020-09-15 22:08:50	+s-d	<g​3r> im probably just gonna make a dockerfile for each container

2020-09-15 22:09:28	Heresiarch	@g3r keep in mind that if these things are to interact with each other, or if they need filesystem mounts, you'll want to turn up a docker-compose.
2020-09-15 22:09:43	+s-d	<g​3r> yes
2020-09-15 22:09:59	+s-d	<g​3r> does the FROM keyword can take a binary exported using docker export name -o bin?
2020-09-15 22:10:28	Heresiarch	FROM can take any reference to a container that's available either in your local repo or on a remote repo.

2020-09-15 22:13:55	+s-d	<g​3r> EXPOSE just port forwards right? i dont see any examples of like EXPOSE 1234:80 which ig it would make the 80 port from the httpd container to the host
2020-09-15 22:14:00	corona266	now when i buy dumb shit i'll just put it on the card and immediately pay it off
2020-09-15 22:14:18	tapoxi	oh boy someone learnin' docker

2020-09-15 22:14:42	Heresiarch	estranger: you bite your tongue.
2020-09-15 22:14:47	tapoxi	expose opens that hole inside the container, when you run it you can forward a host port to the container port
2020-09-15 22:14:50	estranger	youd love it, mr mainframe
2020-09-15 22:14:52	corona266	doesn't even _really_ expose anything
2020-09-15 22:15:03	corona266	"The EXPOSE instruction does not actually publish the port. It functions as a type of documentation between the person who builds the image and the person who runs the container, about which ports are intended to be published."
2020-09-15 22:15:08	estranger	actually
2020-09-15 22:15:09	Heresiarch	estranger: lolno. I like not having to GAF about hardware. :D
2020-09-15 22:15:24	estranger	Heresiarch, do you use ibm mq?
2020-09-15 22:15:39	+s-d	<g​3r> so if i want to expose 80 from the container to 1234 on my host i would use what ?
2020-09-15 22:15:42	Heresiarch	estranger: nope. SQS (activemq under the covers)
2020-09-15 22:15:43	+s-d	<p​arseto> ibm db2?
2020-09-15 22:15:48	tapoxi	I applied to a place doing k8s on bare metal
2020-09-15 22:15:52	estranger	aight
2020-09-15 22:16:01	corona266	@g3r you'd probably use a compose.yml file
2020-09-15 22:16:10	tapoxi	something about a performance boost when doing real-time analytics or something
2020-09-15 22:16:15	+s-d	<g​3r> so theres no way from doing it from the dockerfile
2020-09-15 22:16:17	estranger	i got a customer than expects us to be MQ experts... we're not. they want to get crazy throughput from a MQ server that is 40ms away from us

2020-09-15 22:17:11	estranger	Heresiarch, they are offload from a mainframe onto us

2020-09-15 22:17:50	+s-d	<g​3r> Dockerfile would build the image and the docker compose would run it right
2020-09-15 22:17:51	corona266	yes
2020-09-15 22:17:56	estranger	we can get good throughput from MQ if 1) its local to us and/or 2) they have batching enabled on MQ (the client apparently can set batch sizes w/ mq?)
2020-09-15 22:17:57	tapoxi	yee
2020-09-15 22:18:03	+s-d	<g​3r> fine
2020-09-15 22:18:09	corona266	let me sanitize the yml file I'm looking at and I'll post
2020-09-15 22:18:11	Heresiarch	@g3r - rule of thumb: if it's something inside the container, it goes into the Dockerfile. If it's something to interact with the container, it'll be in a compose file.
2020-09-15 22:18:12	tapoxi	speaking of kubernetes
2020-09-15 22:18:17	estranger	we can do a few hundred mbps with a smaller connect cluster when its local
2020-09-15 22:18:20	tapoxi	anyone have opinions of kong vs ambassador

2020-09-15 22:22:36	Heresiarch	estranger: right. But if they're really wanting this fast, isn't that an upsell opp for an on-prem deploy?

2020-09-15 22:23:45	estranger	if we had a local cluster we chould ingest the MQ damn fast and then mega batch it up over to the cloud pretty darn quickly

2020-09-15 22:24:14	Heresiarch	@CastyMcBoozer pull the plug on the pi?
2020-09-15 22:24:15	corona266	otherwise, if you have central logging, force a log off and watch for an RDP session to open up

2020-09-15 22:25:51	Heresiarch	@g3r what you're trying to is a bit overkill with a container. At the very least, you'd have N sites running on N different ports on your box, and you'd either have to send users URLs with ports in them (looks jank), or you'd have to proxy in front of the containers.

2020-09-15 23:22:19	locknet	but I'm running as root :(
2020-09-15 23:22:57	Heresiarch	locknet: use $UID instead of $EUID ?
2020-09-15 23:23:49	locknet	but why that specific command gives me permission denied?
2020-09-15 23:24:33	locknet	 /tmp directory has 777 permissions 
2020-09-15 23:25:45	Heresiarch	bash -x and debug. Initial guess is that /usr/local/etc doesn't exist.
2020-09-15 23:26:45	Heresiarch	either that, or /usr/local/bin/network_mail isn't chmod +x
2020-09-15 23:28:41	locknet	Heresiarch, network_mail has -rwxr-xr-x
2020-09-15 23:28:51	locknet	so that's not the problem
2020-09-15 23:30:58	locknet	with $UID don't spit permission denied but for some reason doesn't work as expected
2020-09-15 23:32:53	Heresiarch	might be a little more predictable to run the patterns through a for/while loop and readline, rather than trying grep -f
2020-09-15 23:33:56	locknet	Heresiarch, the thing is if I run that command in a separate file, it works great
2020-09-15 23:39:01	locknet	Forget it, it works with $UID, the problem was that the if statement was waiting for fping exit status but when I put the grep above the IF, this takes grep exit status
2020-09-15 23:39:07	locknet	thank you Heresiarch

2020-09-22 21:16:26	Sousapro	What's wrong with PDF? 
2020-09-22 21:16:41	Sousapro	It's great for immutable document transport 
2020-09-22 21:16:48	Heresiarch	^
2020-09-22 21:17:00	Sousapro	You can grossly misuse PDF
2020-09-22 21:17:02	jdgr	Why use PDF instead of HTML?
2020-09-22 21:17:14	+s-d	<H​otmess> did you read the immutablity
2020-09-22 21:17:19	Heresiarch	HTML is easily modified. This is problematic for sveral usecases.
2020-09-22 21:17:20	+AnonymooseReddtr	HTML is easily modifiable

2020-09-22 21:17:29	jdgr	Oh right
2020-09-22 21:17:29	+s-d	<H​otmess> is the reason why pdf is so popular
2020-09-22 21:17:33	jdgr	Overlooked that bit
2020-09-22 21:17:43	derpadmin	you can store executable in pdf... it is a ridiculous standard... a lady was giving a good talk about this
2020-09-22 21:17:44	+s-d	<H​otmess> xps was/is the replacement for it
2020-09-22 21:17:50	+s-d	<H​otmess> but it didnt take off
2020-09-22 21:17:56	+s-d	<H​otmess> you know pdf is such a fuck?
2020-09-22 21:18:00	Sousapro	it also guarantees the document will look identical as well
2020-09-22 21:18:01	PublicWiFi	it was originally used to display on screen in file form, what a printer would see
2020-09-22 21:18:02	+s-d	<H​otmess> mainframes?
2020-09-22 21:18:07	PublicWiFi	aka you didn't have to print shit
2020-09-22 21:18:12	Sousapro	This
2020-09-22 21:18:13	+s-d	<H​otmess> mainframes (edited)
2020-09-22 21:18:20	PublicWiFi	but the standard is literally printer level shit
2020-09-22 21:18:29	PublicWiFi	so editing it and workig with them is a damn pain
2020-09-22 21:18:39	Sousapro	That's a feature lol
2020-09-22 21:18:42	PublicWiFi	lol
2020-09-22 21:18:49	PublicWiFi	it was life changing 30 years ago
2020-09-22 21:18:52	PublicWiFi	time to move on xD
2020-09-22 21:18:53	+s-d	<H​otmess> mainframes use ebcdic
2020-09-22 21:18:53	Sousapro	Use a more malleable format for editing
2020-09-22 21:19:05	+s-d	<H​otmess> there is a lot of pdf processing on mainframes
2020-09-22 21:19:07	PublicWiFi	everyone WANTS pdfs :(
2020-09-22 21:19:16	Sousapro	Yes. It prints perfectly 
2020-09-22 21:19:23	PublicWiFi	im trying to automate the creation of a PDF based on some inputs
2020-09-22 21:19:25	+s-d	<H​otmess> so pdf has to be not mutible when stored as ascii an processed on ebcdic machines
2020-09-22 21:19:25	Sousapro	Until paper is forever dead, PDF is king
2020-09-22 21:19:26	PublicWiFi	and its just a fuckin pain

2020-09-22 21:19:56	Sousapro	Who uses xps though? lol
2020-09-22 21:19:57	PublicWiFi	even the python library ReportLab is kinda complex 
2020-09-22 21:20:11	+s-d	<H​otmess> anyone wanting to archive files mainly
2020-09-22 21:20:32	Sousapro	If it doesn't need to be immutable, store in database

2020-09-22 22:57:26	fritzwastaken	win admin center on the hyper-v server?

2020-09-22 22:58:18	fritzwastaken	I am trying to deploy a Microsoft lab
2020-09-22 22:58:20	Hunterkll	fritzwastaken, the 'easy' way to do this is WAC on the hyper-v server, which gives you most things, or from your non-domain joined workstation, have the same username and password for a local admin on the server and on your workstation 
2020-09-22 22:58:32	Hunterkll	that gets you closer to 'just working'
2020-09-22 22:58:41	+s-d	<H​otmess> or use RSAT
2020-09-22 22:58:49	fritzwastaken	ahhh, since its a workgroup its trying to get a common authentication thread?
2020-09-22 22:58:50	+s-d	<H​otmess> on your non domain worksation
2020-09-22 22:58:51	Hunterkll	that.... is literally what i just told him to do, but how to make it work easily 
2020-09-22 22:59:10	Hunterkll	you use hyper-v manager from the remote workstation, on an account with the same username and password as a local admin on the server
2020-09-22 22:59:24	fritzwastaken	gotcha
2020-09-22 22:59:26	StrongBad	Heresiarch: a sideshow is when like 200 people take over an intersection and do donuts while hanging out of their cars

2020-09-22 22:59:49	fritzwastaken	StrongBad: Oh, so you have been to Baltimore eh?
2020-09-22 22:59:55	Hunterkll	fritzwastaken, honestly, i'd set up a domain controller on top of hyper-v, domain join it, and just run with that :P
2020-09-22 22:59:57	StrongBad	it started in the bay area
2020-09-22 23:00:00	Hunterkll	but lol 
2020-09-22 23:00:34	onenerdyguy	Hunterkll, bet it's core
2020-09-22 23:00:34	fritzwastaken	Hunterkll: lol yea sounding like that may be easier, I just wanted a hypervisor to deploy this MS Endpoint Manager lab in
2020-09-22 23:00:36	Heresiarch	StrongBad: ...riiiiight. People are silly.
2020-09-22 23:00:51	Hunterkll	onenerdyguy, hence why i gave the instructions i gave, if it wasn't core he wouldn't have this issue
2020-09-22 23:00:51	fritzwastaken	and my workstation doesnt have the RAM, so i just threw hyper-v server on my old lab

2020-09-22 23:51:08	Forsythe	Was right after Interstellar came out, whose poster had that awesome render of a black hole, rimmed with light and slashed through with an accretion disc. Was done helping the user after remoting to her computer, and found a useful "Earth orbiting a black hole" gif from a .edu site that was 14MB or something. Knowing the site she was at had crappy bandwidth, I converted it to html5 vid via gfycat, then pasted the 
2020-09-22 23:51:08	Forsythe	URL into her outdated (for compatibility reasons) Internet Explorer, only to have the resulting loop be of two scissoring women.
2020-09-22 23:51:35	Steeve	haha
2020-09-22 23:52:26	Forsythe	Reason being, her version of IE didn't support html5 vids, and so gfycat defaults to what it thinks is the source gif in that case, which was not the actual source gif.
2020-09-22 23:52:38	Steeve	Oh no!
2020-09-22 23:53:03	StrongBad	did you know that a pound of human fat has roughly 17 million joules of energy. a pound of gasoline has 21 million joules

2020-09-22 23:54:19	Steeve	yeah well you sent it to me so....thanks StrongBad 
2020-09-22 23:54:25	Forsythe	Stammering and completely baffled, I wound up making the loop appear on her screen two more times, not understanding the source of the glitch, intent on proving myself innocent. Said something weird like, "No, nooo, no, I... I am exonerated."

2020-09-22 23:56:22	binaryhermit	I'm trying to figure out how the computer decided that
2020-09-22 23:56:22	Forsythe	https://gfycat.com/terrificpleasedcondor -- for years after, the mis-sourced gif version could be triggered, but no longer. Perhaps it got reported at some point. In case it came back to bite me, I made sure it could be reproduced, since... how BS does that sort of explanation sound? "Uh, uh... html5 video, default to gif, database mismatch, uh, uh..."

2020-09-22 23:57:37	StrongBad	interesting, 1kWh is 3.6 million joules, so 1lb of human fat is something like 4.75kWh

If the brain is the hardware and the mind the software, then there really can be nothing called "you" during such a period if there are no synaptic activity. Are you still you when you come back?

2020-09-23 00:40:21	oxipital	local market is basicaly bulshit if youre not TS/SC
2020-09-23 00:40:27	fritzwastaken	Actually, I think my title is "Information Technology Analyst"
2020-09-23 00:40:29	Steeve	oxipital: are you hearing from recruiters
2020-09-23 00:40:29	StrongBad	fritzwastaken: it has pluses and minuses
2020-09-23 00:40:36	StrongBad	I do barely anything anymore but I feel I am wasting away
2020-09-23 00:40:39	oxipital	a few 
2020-09-23 00:40:46	fritzwastaken	I am learning tons
2020-09-23 00:40:54	oxipital	but i think i've applied at the non-clearance jobs
2020-09-23 00:41:04	oxipital	for some reason i'm unemployable
2020-09-23 00:41:10	fritzwastaken	My last jobs have been all fly by the seat of your pants get it done ASAP and move on, this job I get to take my time and learn things
2020-09-23 00:41:11	StrongBad	I have learned a lot of stuff about boats and mining and stuff from youtube
2020-09-23 00:41:22	oxipital	which i wouldnt care about
2020-09-23 00:41:24	fritzwastaken	Ive learned a ton of powershell, automation etc
2020-09-23 00:41:24	Forsythe	brb
2020-09-23 00:41:28	oxipital	but i like buying stuff
2020-09-23 00:41:32	Steeve	oxipital: i know those systems do OCR / language processing to extract all the keywords...so it matters if specific tech/concepts etc are listed on the resume
2020-09-23 00:41:40	oxipital	yeah i know
2020-09-23 00:41:44	Steeve	ah okay good
2020-09-23 00:41:49	JollyRgrs	Steeve is correct
2020-09-23 00:41:56	oxipital	i've put keywords and time spent using them on the resume, etc etc
2020-09-23 00:41:58	JollyRgrs	have an "SEO" section in your resume
2020-09-23 00:42:00	fritzwastaken	oxipital: tiny white text with all the top keywords at the bottom of your resume
2020-09-23 00:42:06	JollyRgrs	also, linkedin has really helped me in searching for jobs
2020-09-23 00:42:13	fritzwastaken	all the OCR systems will love you
2020-09-23 00:42:21	JollyRgrs	make sure that is set up well, and actually connect with some of the recruiters
2020-09-23 00:42:27	Steeve	I got assblasted by recruiters after dropping resume into the sites like indeed
2020-09-23 00:42:27	oxipital	yeah indeed's kind of went downhill.
2020-09-23 00:42:31	StrongBad	use terms FROM the job description
2020-09-23 00:42:38	JollyRgrs	^^
2020-09-23 00:42:49	JollyRgrs	you should have a unique resume for each job you apply for
2020-09-23 00:42:54	StrongBad	yes
2020-09-23 00:43:12	oxipital	see if that's what's required, i'll stick to the dole
2020-09-23 00:43:17	JollyRgrs	not always much diff... but hit the points they are looking for the hardest
2020-09-23 00:43:35	jdgr	well may be getting a position paying $25/hr
2020-09-23 00:43:42	jdgr	warehouse IT support
2020-09-23 00:43:43	oxipital	if it's a recruiter i'm submitting to for them to submit me for a job, let them "personalize" it
2020-09-23 00:43:43	Steeve	noice
2020-09-23 00:43:52	oxipital	congrats
2020-09-23 00:43:53	StrongBad	oxipital: what if you chose an employer you actually wanted to work for though

2020-09-23 00:45:16	StrongBad	do you ever get the impulse to work for a specific company or org
2020-09-23 00:45:18	jdgr	i want a job where i'm forced to learn all of the time and am apart of a diverse team
2020-09-23 00:45:19	oxipital	the usual, windows server, desktop, AD, O365, some DB experience, some linux experience
2020-09-23 00:45:25	jdgr	where corporate culture's a big deal
2020-09-23 00:45:27	oxipital	i'm actually considering the PMP cert
2020-09-23 00:45:35	oxipital	do a lateral
2020-09-23 00:45:39	jdgr	with flexible scheduling, that's remote
2020-09-23 00:46:10	oxipital	then i'll never have to plug in some desk borne illness's computer again
2020-09-23 00:46:18	jdgr	it'd be great if i could make all the decisions

2020-09-23 00:47:03	jdgr	so you can go take a nap
2020-09-23 00:47:03	Steeve	:D
2020-09-23 00:47:13	@d1	no one *actually* enjoys linux
2020-09-23 00:47:17	Steeve	I do!
2020-09-23 00:47:18	jdgr	i enjoy linux

2020-09-23 00:47:26	oxipital	gnu/linux
2020-09-23 00:47:31	oxipital	and RMS does.
2020-09-23 00:47:32	@d1	they've been coerced into that feeling

2020-09-23 00:47:45	fritzwastaken	blah
2020-09-23 00:47:50	StrongBad	I honestly find it surprising y'all still care about computers/tech
2020-09-23 00:47:52	@d1	and I assure you, no one *actually* enjoys windows either.
2020-09-23 00:47:57	StrongBad	I've grown to hate it
2020-09-23 00:48:04	jdgr	what if i run OpenBSD's userland ontop of the linux kernel and compile everything with clang/llvm
2020-09-23 00:48:09	jdgr	is it still gnu/linux
2020-09-23 00:48:09	oxipital	StrongBad: i've found when i'm not doing it as a job, it's great
2020-09-23 00:48:11	Steeve	there you go
2020-09-23 00:48:16	oxipital	but i think that's more the jobs fault
2020-09-23 00:48:28	oxipital	like they've welded computers in to customer service
2020-09-23 00:48:48	jdgr	what if if instead of the gnu c standard library i use musl
2020-09-23 00:48:49	fritzwastaken	StrongBad: I care enough to learn more to make more money, I am not a hobby-est
2020-09-23 00:48:57	StrongBad	I just don't care about any of it anymore
2020-09-23 00:49:01	StrongBad	it's a way to make money
2020-09-23 00:49:07	Steeve	<--- nerd....i'd do it even if i didn't get paid
2020-09-23 00:49:09	oxipital	so to do the computer bit for money you do 3x the time spent on that doing customer service
2020-09-23 00:49:50	jdgr	i dont want to do customer service
2020-09-23 00:49:52	jdgr	nobody does
2020-09-23 00:49:58	oxipital	if i saw a true relationship between learning more and earnings i'd probably care more
2020-09-23 00:50:06	jdgr	unless the customers are educated and interesting 
2020-09-23 00:50:06	oxipital	but for me, i haven't seen the relationship

2020-09-23 00:50:26	oxipital	jdgr: yeah i loved supporting researchers in this bioinformatics institute
2020-09-23 00:50:30	Steeve	agree with fritzwastaken 
2020-09-23 00:50:33	oxipital	always something interesting
2020-09-23 00:50:35	JollyRgrs	yeah, you gotta learn a new skill to put it on your resume so you can get a better job
2020-09-23 00:50:42	oxipital	they loved to talk about their work
2020-09-23 00:50:43	@d1	me_irl: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/e0TF0EPs/image.png
2020-09-23 00:50:56	JollyRgrs	and 9/10 you gotta not just change roles, but change companies to get the $ more than 5%
2020-09-23 00:51:08	oxipital	their work was more than "i convert these signed documents to pdf and facebook tee hee"
2020-09-23 00:51:08	fritzwastaken	No job is going to pay you more because you learned some linux or docker on the side
2020-09-23 00:51:10	JollyRgrs	d1: right on man
2020-09-23 00:51:14	fritzwastaken	But being able to talk about it in an interview helps
2020-09-23 00:51:24	Steeve	+ if you have an "easy" job while you are learning
2020-09-23 00:51:31	Steeve	can use extra time to build skillset

2020-09-23 00:51:37	oxipital	true dat
2020-09-23 00:51:45	oxipital	or an employer who values self education
2020-09-23 00:51:49	JollyRgrs	also... homelabs matter
2020-09-23 00:51:52	oxipital	the old google 80/20 rule
2020-09-23 00:51:59	oxipital	which they flushed
2020-09-23 00:52:01	Steeve	you're going to become the master of the universe at kubernetes.....and will be making $150k in  few years oxipital , no worries
2020-09-23 00:52:09	JollyRgrs	no, it doesn't show "enterprise experience" but it shows that A) you take initiative to learn things and B) you at least have familiarity with it

2020-09-23 00:52:42	oxipital	or i could man up and go do my phd
2020-09-23 00:52:43	StrongBad	you can make 150k if you have nothing tying you down
2020-09-23 00:52:57	StrongBad	I know a lot of really skilled people who are making a lot less
2020-09-23 00:53:19	+s-d	<N​eo> Just quickly, does anyone know of a no-cost mapping solution? Preferably something I could leverage and graph via PHP. Trying to build a custom outage map in an existing bespoke solution

2020-09-23 00:54:28	oxipital	and so it begins
2020-09-23 00:54:33	StrongBad	I'd prefer 4x10hr days
2020-09-23 00:54:36	StrongBad	or 3x10hr days
2020-09-23 00:54:38	rpifan	yes
2020-09-23 00:54:44	@d1	more edits
2020-09-23 00:54:47	oxipital	hopefully this signals the end of the 40 hour slave system
2020-09-23 00:54:53	oxipital	well "40"
2020-09-23 00:55:05	oxipital	because lets be honest
2020-09-23 00:55:20	+s-d	<G​ene> you can find a job that does 4x10 hours already, however that doesn't work for everyone's schedules, while everyone can do 5x6 or 3x8+6 or whatnot
2020-09-23 00:55:27	oxipital	even the lowliest of cable swappers is expected to stay until the works done
2020-09-23 00:55:31	+s-d	<G​ene> i like 5x6 because moving to 6 hour shifts means 4x shifts in a day instead.
2020-09-23 00:55:33	jdgr	heck i have 2x 10 hr days and 4x 8 hr days

2020-09-23 00:58:40	oxipital	fuck "working towards" anything. i've been working towards moving in to more senior positions for a decade now.
2020-09-23 00:59:14	jdgr	one of the issues with being underworked is you have no free time and youre doing repetitive, menial tasks
2020-09-23 00:59:16	jdgr	so your skills atrophy 
2020-09-23 00:59:25	jdgr	or you have to sacrifice time with your SO
2020-09-23 00:59:45	Steeve	oxipital: i agree with what someone else said about having to hop positions
2020-09-23 00:59:56	Steeve	i've been "promoted" before but usually the pay difference was very little

2020-09-23 01:00:56	Steeve	It does kind of make sense from a business standpoint if they are trying to keep costs low
2020-09-23 01:00:56	oxipital	most pay raises ive gotten have been slight too
2020-09-23 01:01:07	Steeve	if they are used to getting you for X..... they really don't want to move that number up
2020-09-23 01:01:31	+s-d	<r​mg22893> promotions here are 10% or the bottom of the new payscale, whichever is greater.

2020-09-23 01:05:37	oxipital	yeah that own dime is some b/s
2020-09-23 01:05:44	corona266	probably would recoup your losses in a few months
2020-09-23 01:05:46	+s-d	<G​ene> yeah, even more so for $126k a year job.
2020-09-23 01:05:53	+s-d	<G​ene> maybe impossible to find housing in their area?

2020-09-23 01:05:58	+s-d	<G​ene> So, 45-60 min commute?

2020-09-23 01:12:11	StrongBad	uni work is a strange beast for sure
2020-09-23 01:12:22	Steeve	^^
2020-09-23 01:12:31	oxipital	^^ but fun
2020-09-23 01:12:32	+s-d	<G​ene> k12 admins -- most are 2nd careers rather than actually wanting to do that.
2020-09-23 01:12:37	oxipital	fuck it. phd it is.
2020-09-23 01:12:38	StrongBad	depends on your department
2020-09-23 01:12:39	+s-d	<G​ene> who even wants to be an IT admin for a school.
2020-09-23 01:12:45	oxipital	well true
2020-09-23 01:12:52	oxipital	i enjoyed the research side
2020-09-23 01:12:53	StrongBad	depends on your departmental budget, type of faculty, grad students
2020-09-23 01:12:56	StrongBad	grad students are the worst
2020-09-23 01:13:01	 *	d1 spins around in his chair
2020-09-23 01:13:02	oxipital	hated working in the outreach/fundraising dept
2020-09-23 01:13:06	oxipital	fucking msp
2020-09-23 01:13:09	Steeve	StrongBad: yes 100%
2020-09-23 01:13:17	oxipital	StrongBad: i can understand why though
2020-09-23 01:13:25	Steeve	some university jobs pay somewhat poorly but can have INSANELY good benefits
2020-09-23 01:13:26	oxipital	they're being treated as special
2020-09-23 01:13:34	oxipital	and have a lot invested in what they're doing
2020-09-23 01:13:36	oxipital	^^^
2020-09-23 01:13:37	StrongBad	also depending on your uni, uni IT is probably mostly departmental based
2020-09-23 01:13:46	StrongBad	which means every department has to reinvent a lot of wheels
2020-09-23 01:13:50	StrongBad	a lot of hats of IT folks
2020-09-23 01:13:52	oxipital	virginia tech had the best insurance i ever had
2020-09-23 01:13:55	corona266	and it's pretty fun when you're uni tier 1 IT
2020-09-23 01:14:25	StrongBad	I think uni it is better than hospital IT though
2020-09-23 01:14:30	StrongBad	_that_ was the worst
2020-09-23 01:14:49	oxipital	yeah medical doctors seem to be a perfect mix of stupid and needy
2020-09-23 01:14:52	int0x1C8	fritzwastaken, fellow easytech veteran?
2020-09-23 01:15:02	oxipital	i seriously think medschool is 95% memorization
2020-09-23 01:15:10	StrongBad	hospital IT is stressful and gross
2020-09-23 01:15:19	StrongBad	and a lot of the people you support have large egos
2020-09-23 01:15:30	oxipital	yeah
2020-09-23 01:15:48	StrongBad	also going in patient rooms is so awkward
2020-09-23 01:16:10	int0x1C8	working at staples was the fucking worst
2020-09-23 01:16:23	Jaelae	worst place i worked had the best benefits
2020-09-23 01:16:31	Jaelae	and they told you when you didnt get a raise that you had the best benefits
2020-09-23 01:16:40	StrongBad	sounds like a uni
2020-09-23 01:16:43	Steeve	yep
2020-09-23 01:16:46	DOMF	I just did IT for my kid's school
2020-09-23 01:16:49	Jaelae	it was a midsize business
2020-09-23 01:16:52	int0x1C8	you'd think office politics wouldn't apply in retail environments, but I ended up quitting on the spot over some office drama bullshit
2020-09-23 01:16:55	DOMF	because they have one IT person for the whole district 
2020-09-23 01:17:00	Jaelae	i was the sole IT and they had about 90 employees when i started but brought in 140 million net profits
2020-09-23 01:17:26	DOMF	my kid's teacher needed an external monitor so I went to her classroom and gave her one and helped her out with a couple other things, another teacher saw me doing it and pulled me in to help her with stuff
2020-09-23 01:17:36	Jaelae	i know this cause i had to do end of year closing on their books since i was in "IT"
2020-09-23 01:17:46	StrongBad	DOMF: #richestcountryintheworld
2020-09-23 01:17:50	oxipital	yeah k12 IT will be a growth market next two years or so
2020-09-23 01:17:51	DOMF	mhmm
2020-09-23 01:18:06	oxipital	god i hope things stay the way they are re: remoting post covid
2020-09-23 01:18:10	DOMF	if they could pay me anywhere near what I make now I'd jump ship 
2020-09-23 01:18:12	DOMF	but they can't
2020-09-23 01:18:22	oxipital	i'd hate to see the progress made about how people can do their jobs dissolve
2020-09-23 01:18:31	DOMF	it will oxipital 
2020-09-23 01:18:34	int0x1C8	and my first summer out of high school I worked for another high school's IT dept
2020-09-23 01:18:35	DOMF	it already has to an extent

2020-09-23 01:24:05	oxipital	they probably dont care

2020-09-23 01:24:08	StrongBad	it's cheaper to not have real estate

2020-09-23 01:24:29	oxipital	but they're locked in to leases
2020-09-23 01:24:33	+s-d	<G​ene> that's why they're doing it.
2020-09-23 01:24:40	StrongBad	lots of people are paying millions to break leases
2020-09-23 01:24:42	oxipital	i hate working at companies like that
2020-09-23 01:24:52	StrongBad	didn't one just pay like 90 something million
2020-09-23 01:25:00	oxipital	cram a bunch of people into one part of this huge company facility
2020-09-23 01:25:06	int0x1C8	the other buildings have just become dumping grounds for office furniture and shit
2020-09-23 01:25:24	StrongBad	pinterest did it, yep. 90 million to terminate lease
2020-09-23 01:25:31	oxipital	int0x1C8: yeah a lot of call centers and factories are like that
2020-09-23 01:25:41	StrongBad	I guess you can call that an operating loss and not pay taxes int0x1C8 
2020-09-23 01:25:48	int0x1C8	we're a landscaping company
2020-09-23 01:25:50	oxipital	most companies dont have tech money laying around
2020-09-23 01:26:31	StrongBad	we spent nearly our entire IT budget on one VM server
2020-09-23 01:26:40	StrongBad	r440 w/ 64gb of ram lol
2020-09-23 01:27:00	oxipital	it's ok
2020-09-23 01:27:07	oxipital	companies will end up being evicted
2020-09-23 01:27:21	oxipital	so it'll have the same effect but the company will be insolvent
2020-09-23 01:27:42	int0x1C8	but that's the weird thing about here, they're totally willing to cut the shit out of retail employees hours to meet IT needs, like we even hired a 4th IT guy 3 months ago
2020-09-23 01:28:14	DOMF	StrongBad, is your IT budget.... very small?
2020-09-23 01:28:22	StrongBad	like 10k
2020-09-23 01:28:31	StrongBad	we spent about $5400 on this server
2020-09-23 01:28:57	DOMF	I think our monthly aws bill is around that
2020-09-23 01:29:11	StrongBad	skimped on ram, going to upgrade later. 2x xeon silver 8 cores and 8x SSDs with a decent controller
2020-09-23 01:29:20	StrongBad	oh damn my AWS bill is like $5
2020-09-23 01:29:28	DOMF	lol
2020-09-23 01:29:44	StrongBad	we have like 3TB on aws glacier for disaster recovery
2020-09-23 01:29:56	DOMF	we have some very large very expensive database instances 
2020-09-23 01:30:04	int0x1C8	our AWS is $0 because we do _everything_ on prem still
2020-09-23 01:30:06	DOMF	that we can't use RDS for so they have to be ec2
2020-09-23 01:30:43	DOMF	also paying for way more storage than we actually use because they base your disk throughput amount on the size of the volume 
2020-09-23 01:30:46	int0x1C8	4 VM hosts, 2 SANs, about 20 switches
2020-09-23 01:31:37	fritzwastaken	oh look at mister fancy pants VIIIIRTUAL MACHINES int0x1C8 over here
2020-09-23 01:32:05	fritzwastaken	I have a 1:1 ratio of Windows GUI's to physical servers
2020-09-23 01:32:08	Steeve	smh too cool for us with your vmware and hyper-v
2020-09-23 01:32:25	int0x1C8	I'm just saying we probably have well over $100k in on-prem hardware
2020-09-23 01:32:34	jdgr	should i build a single board ARM solution cluster

2020-09-23 02:28:27	+s-d	<H​otmess> you need some serious network hardware though

2020-09-23 02:33:23	+s-d	<H​otmess> so you dont really wanna impact that perfomance just fore MORE ZFS
2020-09-23 02:33:38	+s-d	<H​otmess> you can mix ssd with hdds to improve the cache speed
2020-09-23 02:33:49	+s-d	<H​otmess> and use ram as direct high speed cache in a zfs pool

2020-09-23 04:21:05	+s-d	<S​cruffy> On-prem AD can't see a specific SMTP address, that O365 is seeing, which is preventing me from using it

2020-09-23 04:21:24	+s-d	<S​cruffy> when I try to remove the SMTP address, O365 complains, saying I must do it from on-prem
2020-09-23 04:21:31	+s-d	<S​cruffy> they do
2020-09-23 04:21:47	+s-d	<H​otmess> thats cause of lack of writeback
2020-09-23 04:22:30	+s-d	<S​cruffy> I knew that, but it's irritating af when it won't write-back the thing I need to remove
2020-09-23 04:22:55	+s-d	<H​otmess> you can use the ps script editor to remote deploy a ps script to do it...
2020-09-23 04:23:18	+s-d	<H​otmess> which is a haxy way around it
2020-09-23 04:23:31	+s-d	<r​mg22893> Delete and recreate as a regular security group?
2020-09-23 04:24:40	+s-d	<S​cruffy> @Hotmess you mean like the Exchange Online Powershell module?
2020-09-23 04:24:50	+s-d	<H​otmess> yup or the azure one
2020-09-23 04:24:54	+s-d	<S​cruffy> @rmg22893 Would like to avoid that as the group is used in multiple places
2020-09-23 04:25:05	+s-d	<S​cruffy> tried that, still says I have to do it on-prem

2020-09-23 04:26:27	+s-d	<H​otmess> i guess you just gonna have to do it on prem then
2020-09-23 04:27:48	+s-d	<S​cruffy> it's the .onmicrosoft.com alias :/

2020-09-23 04:28:38	+s-d	<H​otmess> do you know where that group is used?
2020-09-23 04:29:01	+s-d	<H​otmess> cause it might be easy to setup a dynamic gorup to do the job and sub that in

2020-09-23 06:01:32	+s-d	<H​otmess> empire have emipire knights + reiksguard
2020-09-23 06:01:45	+s-d	<H​otmess> i am not sure they really need light cav with their pistoleers
2020-09-23 06:01:54	+s-d	<C​olour> Oh god when I was playing as bloody Tilea, Mousillon took over a huge amount of the map and felt bloody unstoppable
2020-09-23 06:02:09	+s-d	<H​otmess> yeah they kinda do given a good birth
2020-09-23 06:02:20	+s-d	<C​olour> Pistoleers are shitty ranged units I wanted fast light cav for flanking/morale damage while infantry were in melee
2020-09-23 06:02:31	+s-d	<C​olour> If Mousillon bloody takes over it's insane
2020-09-23 06:02:46	+s-d	<H​otmess> i dont really have a problem with kiling undead as empire
2020-09-23 06:03:02	+s-d	<H​otmess> then again i kinda build a hit team to kill the heros
2020-09-23 06:03:12	+s-d	<C​olour> I don't remember exactly what it was maybe it was the mods I had but they were INSANE because they had fear and terror units and made it REAL HARD for me

2020-09-23 06:03:28	+s-d	<C​olour> If they have bloody 5 high level vampires and agents, and big monster units, it's insane
2020-09-23 06:03:29	+s-d	<H​otmess> and pref a light mage
2020-09-23 06:03:41	+s-d	<H​otmess> yeah they got a pretty funny terror bomb
2020-09-23 06:04:25	+s-d	<C​olour> I had to pull all my guys into one big pile surrounded by heroes to try and bolster their morale, greatsworders all over the place. My gunners had a hard time taking out all their monsters in time and couldn't snipe their heroes because they had bloody fliers.
2020-09-23 06:04:43	+s-d	<C​olour> Lost so many battles and so many guys it was insanity

2020-09-23 06:04:56	+s-d	<H​otmess> they have charge defence against all

2020-09-23 06:05:14	+s-d	<H​otmess> greatswords without buffs from karl or bathazar ll ablitys are damage dealwer
2020-09-23 06:05:31	+s-d	<C​olour> The problem was everyone getting worn down and running away

2020-09-23 06:05:53	+s-d	<H​otmess> if you kill all the heros their amy crumbles like instantly
2020-09-23 06:05:59	+s-d	<C​olour> Yeah that was the problem I couldn't do that
2020-09-23 06:06:10	+s-d	<H​otmess> not using franz on deathclaw?
2020-09-23 06:06:15	+s-d	<C​olour> This was as Tilea
2020-09-23 06:06:19	+s-d	<C​olour> I was Tilea
2020-09-23 06:06:19	+s-d	<H​otmess> ah right
2020-09-23 06:06:28	+s-d	<H​otmess> no griphon then?
2020-09-23 06:06:46	+s-d	<C​olour> I think I did have one at some point but that didn't help much against like, 5 agents and tons of monsters and infinite undead
2020-09-23 06:07:02	+s-d	<C​olour> Hardest battle I ever had in Warhammer Total War ever, by far

2020-09-23 06:13:09	+s-d	<C​olour> I did the same with Shogun 2. I rebalanced the whole game and changed the mechanics so that what mattered more is if you was a peasant or a samurai and not what weapon they had. Really changed the dynamic of sieges as you basically needed samurai for being shock troops to survive climbing the walls. Was great.
2020-09-23 06:13:30	+s-d	<C​olour> .... Made horses charging in more fun and send people flying.

2020-09-23 08:38:15	+a1	yeah i agree man
2020-09-23 08:38:20	d1	although, the fire, I think, was caused by him tbh
2020-09-23 08:38:24	+a1	i hope it keeps improving for him though

2020-09-23 08:40:25	+a1	apparently fire inspectors are really good at picking that sort of stuff up, whether it was intentional or not
2020-09-23 08:40:26	d1	ofc it is, and even the fire marshall will say its because of x or y

2020-09-23 09:47:30	+s-d	<N​oob> I'm a network admin for the military, but trying to explore options once my contract ends. Both for sanity of hopefully liking my job and going for a good quality of life. I definitely do not have a normal admin role.

2020-09-23 09:51:53	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> But Being on this project I am the sole developer
2020-09-23 09:51:56	+s-d	<m​atthew> instead of sysadmins build infra and devs have to make it work with the sysadmins, but instead devops build infra around the developers code to be automated in testing etc
2020-09-23 09:52:55	+s-d	<m​atthew> so for example, I have a code base on github, I would go in there, write some sort of code that spin stuff up on aws/on prem infra, that deploys the application

2020-09-23 09:59:50	+s-d	<N​oob> But can't labbing in the cloud cost quite a bit when trials end? I'm broke af
2020-09-23 10:00:14	+s-d	<m​atthew> well depends
2020-09-23 10:00:33	+s-d	<m​atthew> for example, a t2 instance with 1GB of ram and 2vCores is 10$ a month
2020-09-23 10:00:44	+s-d	<N​oob> When start using various tools and features instead of just a vm on a tiny VPS
2020-09-23 10:00:46	+s-d	<m​atthew> so you need 2, and a LB for a proper 3 tier app, so 40$ a month

2020-09-23 10:02:15	+s-d	<m​atthew> 128GB of ram is like breakfast for enterprise workloads

2020-09-23 14:51:09	catbeard	no honestly but maybe limit to 1 a month
2020-09-23 14:51:21	catbeard	because the companies will call each other and ask about you

2020-09-23 14:56:12	rpifan	germans pay me 70 percent of my salary for 6 months
2020-09-23 14:56:15	rpifan	i see that as a plus
2020-09-23 14:56:28	rpifan	would give me enough time to go to chile build the house i want
2020-09-23 14:56:33	rpifan	and then live in japan for a few months

2020-09-23 15:51:54	corona266	oh jeez
2020-09-23 15:52:04	corona266	entire security posture
2020-09-23 15:52:28	catbeard	personal security, or corporate security policy
2020-09-23 15:53:25	corona266	information system security, will eventually get rolled into a system security plan... when we eventually hire the guy who's _actual_ job is this
2020-09-23 15:54:34	catbeard	do you have compliance requirements?
2020-09-23 15:55:00	corona266	Yes, but they never had any teeth until just recently
2020-09-23 15:55:38	corona266	It was easy to say "oh we don't need this, that, or the other" when it was just 4 guys in an office with a samba server
2020-09-23 15:55:38	catbeard	then that's where i'd start writing down answers those compliance regs would ask, and use that as a basis to help you fill out the paperwork you have
2020-09-23 15:55:53	corona266	Yea, that's what I'm doing

2020-09-23 15:58:03	+s-d	<P​hoenix> I need to navigate some restricted webpages in my country as if I were navigating them from other -specific- countries, so I want to use proxies
2020-09-23 15:58:15	corona266	Yep, back before CMMC you could fill out a POA&M and never actually do the security aspect
2020-09-23 15:58:21	catbeard	@Phoenix, mullvad VPN country selector?
2020-09-23 15:58:22	PipeItToDevNull	XD yep
2020-09-23 15:58:22	corona266	Now POA&M's aren't a thing

2020-09-23 15:59:41	catbeard	@Phoenix, the vpn client itself has a country selector tool for just that purpose
2020-09-23 15:59:57	catbeard	also mullvad doesn't log and has a killswitch
2020-09-23 16:00:12	+s-d	<P​hoenix> is it free?
2020-09-23 16:00:15	+s-d	<H​otmess> allegedly:)
2020-09-23 16:00:15	catbeard	no
2020-09-23 16:00:24	+s-d	<P​hoenix> does it have a chrome extension?
2020-09-23 16:00:25	corona266	Yep. I've never done compliance for a full network, so this is all new to me
2020-09-23 16:00:33	catbeard	the only thing they log is the connection time and account id
2020-09-23 16:00:35	PipeItToDevNull	me_irl

2020-09-23 16:00:53	+s-d	<P​hoenix> right now im using tunnelbear for that purpose
2020-09-23 16:00:54	catbeard	corona266: start with compliance for a single system, and work your way around the OSI layers
2020-09-23 16:01:10	corona266	I'll have to do that after this self assessment
2020-09-23 16:01:12	+s-d	<P​hoenix> but i want something simplier and cheaper but i havent found a way to acquire just the servers i need instead of a whole package
2020-09-23 16:01:12	PipeItToDevNull	We have been working on CMMC for 2 years now 
2020-09-23 16:01:44	PipeItToDevNull	Made a DMZ for 800-171, now I need to destroy it for CMMC and bring all that shit back internal 
2020-09-23 16:01:45	corona266	I told $boss we needed to start it at the beginning of last year, but I was never allocated time to do it
2020-09-23 16:01:48	catbeard	@Phoenix, that's the thing though you don't need the server, though digitalocean is pretty cheap if it's just for a SOCKS5 tunnel or quick openvpn box
2020-09-23 16:02:11	+s-d	<P​hoenix> so you would use vpns instead of proxies for that purpose?
2020-09-23 16:02:24	catbeard	depends on what you mean by restricted @Phoenix
2020-09-23 16:02:26	+s-d	<P​hoenix> but i need something i can put in a chrome extension
2020-09-23 16:02:27	PipeItToDevNull	WIth the devs getting all up in their panties about admin. I have one user with a magic git client that needs admin, so a PM took over all security for that contract and it is going to be fucking hilarious when our audit comes around 
2020-09-23 16:02:46	catbeard	@Phoenix, in that case foxyproxy chrome extension and socks5
2020-09-23 16:02:56	catbeard	easy to do with ssh only
2020-09-23 16:03:06	+s-d	<P​hoenix> there are webpages I need to access that are country restricted, and I need to acces them like if i was navigating to them from certain countries, and it needs to be done using a chrome extension
2020-09-23 16:03:14	corona266	wtf a git client that needs admin?
2020-09-23 16:03:26	PipeItToDevNull	That is what I said 
2020-09-23 16:03:35	corona266	why tho
2020-09-23 16:03:53	PipeItToDevNull	Every other dev works just fine, and I run the git server so I fucking know too. But whatever, management went with it 
2020-09-23 16:04:05	+s-d	<H​otmess> your better off using Tor for that
2020-09-23 16:04:11	+s-d	<P​hoenix> @Phoenix, in that case foxyproxy chrome extension and socks5
2020-09-23 16:04:11	+s-d	<P​hoenix> @catbeard (irc)#0000 but what I need now are the proxy servers in certain countries only like germany and france for instance so it doesnt cost hundres a month
2020-09-23 16:04:12	+s-d	<H​otmess> than chrome
2020-09-23 16:04:21	+s-d	<H​otmess> chrome screws shit everywhere
2020-09-23 16:04:21	+s-d	<P​hoenix> your better off using Tor for that
2020-09-23 16:04:21	+s-d	<P​hoenix> @Hotmess off the table. it has to be chrome

2020-09-23 16:04:36	+s-d	<P​hoenix> nope, it has to be chrome

2020-09-23 16:05:38	catbeard	if you're a student even more credit
2020-09-23 16:06:31	catbeard	spin up a linux server, ssh -D SOCKS5PORTHERE root@server.ip, then tell chrome foxyproxy to use socks5 on 127.0.0.1:SOCKS5PORTHERE

2020-09-23 18:03:25	DomLS3	sometimes 8 months unless a new 0day comes out
2020-09-23 18:03:43	aleph-	@reg22891 I mean daily automated patches count

2020-09-23 18:05:22	+s-d	<N​oob> I wish we had simply patching in my world
2020-09-23 18:05:59	+s-d	<r​mg22893> be the change control you wish to see in the world
2020-09-23 18:05:59	aleph-	Somehow went from a network error with our vpn, to why do we even need this for all our hosts? Just do firewall rules on our config management master for every host we add to it. What's the value prop for the added complexity.
2020-09-23 18:06:19	aleph-	Which... they are related, but how the fuck did we end up there?
2020-09-23 18:06:24	+s-d	<N​oob> Updates for networking involved copying a half gig file to every of the 1k+ devices,  reinstalling the firmware, and a reboot. Som areas are hard to get approval for a reboot cuz "It cAN NeVER gO D0wn
2020-09-23 18:06:41	+s-d	<r​mg22893> Ansible my dude
2020-09-23 18:06:47	+s-d	<N​oob> We have solarwinds
2020-09-23 18:07:15	aleph-	Been meaning to try out ansible on some openBSD VM's at home
2020-09-23 18:07:29	+s-d	<N​oob> When covid hit and we went home i just worked evening and updated half the network in a week. Downtime don't matter if there is no one on site to notice
2020-09-23 18:07:38	+s-d	<r​mg22893> it's slow as balls at scale sometimes but it works well otherwise
2020-09-23 18:08:08	+s-d	<r​mg22893> though mitogen makes it much faster if you're lucky enough to be all linux
2020-09-23 18:08:15	+s-d	<r​mg22893> unfortunately no such luck for windows boxes
2020-09-23 18:08:30	+s-d	<N​oob> Very little Linux at work.
2020-09-23 18:08:53	+s-d	<r​mg22893> it works for Windows as well but it just...takes its time
2020-09-23 18:09:16	aleph-	Yeah I use salt-stack at work, and nixOS at home
2020-09-23 18:09:19	+s-d	<N​oob> 10k+ win 10 domain environment. I'm only responsible for about a dozen network support servers atm
2020-09-23 18:09:33	aleph-	Scales well but has some sec annoyances
2020-09-23 18:10:06	+s-d	<N​oob> Gpo, sccm, etc for the standard OS changes and patches. But the application side all manual as were the only ones running our type of specialized programs
2020-09-23 18:10:47	+s-d	<N​oob> Our sysadmins are scared to touch our servers because no one wants to learn our stuff
2020-09-23 18:11:17	+s-d	<r​mg22893> i'll patch servers that I have no idea what they're doing, I don't give a damn lol
2020-09-23 18:11:22	+s-d	<N​oob> Lmao
2020-09-23 18:11:35	+s-d	<N​oob> I meant more like patching and updated the Cisco software
2020-09-23 18:12:05	+s-d	<N​oob> Plus we prefer having full control of our own servers because we're bottom heavy on experience here
2020-09-23 18:12:08	+s-d	<r​mg22893> APIC or something?
2020-09-23 18:12:23	corona266	So, for those of you who use ansible, how do you have the ansible account set up on servers?
2020-09-23 18:13:36	+s-d	<N​oob> Standard network suite. SolarWinds, Cisco ACS, Cisco ISE, Cisco Unified Call Manager, and some more specialized software. But a bad patch will literally taking thousands of people offline depending on which server even with "HA"
2020-09-23 18:14:00	+s-d	<r​mg22893> For windows, just an account with admin rights, ansible auths with kerberos for domain machines and NTLM for non-domain
2020-09-23 18:14:51	+s-d	<N​oob> Don't know a single person who knows ansible and only a few know python. Ya feel fringe to cringe. Most people have less than 2 years of experience yet full control
2020-09-23 18:15:25	+s-d	<N​oob> I have 3 years of experience. In 3 years I went from network tech to network admin to network architect
2020-09-23 18:16:18	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> but isn't that cool? reminds me of a scene in a game where a npc controls a nuclear power plant and when you ask him how he got the position
2020-09-23 18:16:18	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> he answers "i told them i have a degree in physics" lol
2020-09-23 18:17:49	+s-d	<N​oob> Lol. I came back from another site, closed the most tickets in a month beating everyone about 5X first month back. Went from I can't remove all of commands to God rights and delegated authority to tell me old time to work stuff I don't want to or have time for

2020-09-23 18:19:44	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> so when I asked a friend if you can graduate computer science and work as a SysAdmin he said no. No one would hire you because of a paper. You would have to start as desk help and climb the ladder up. Is that true?
2020-09-23 18:20:20	+s-d	<N​oob> So I'm in the military so my ladder works alot differently
2020-09-23 18:21:51	+s-d	<N​oob> But I started with home networking and consumer pics, and joined. Now working on my bachelors, pushing for advanced certs, and am looking at network engineering, architect, and sr cloud admin types roles. Looking for something in the $80k+

2020-09-23 18:25:44	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> @rmg22893 yea that's exactly what I'm thinking about. Either SysAdmin or Dev Job looks good. I just don't have a clue how SysAdmin is

2020-09-23 18:26:27	corona266	granted, $old_admin didn't listen when I told him we shouldn't do our own cable for the server rack, and also didn't listen when I told him we need a root CA -> child CA -> certs

2020-09-23 18:27:27	+s-d	<N​oob> I do some sysadmin roles which is why I lurk
2020-09-23 18:27:41	+s-d	<r​mg22893> i've gone to great efforts to automate as much of my job as humanly possible so I don't do much unless something blows up
2020-09-23 18:28:25	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> so it's a good job then? compared to dev with deadlines, bugs and scrum meetings?
2020-09-23 18:28:26	corona266	a1: I currently have it set up to use a password from an ansible-vault dependent on the machine since I haven't set up central auth for our service servers
2020-09-23 18:28:32	+s-d	<r​mg22893> it's alright
2020-09-23 18:28:36	+s-d	<r​mg22893> it's pretty boring now to be honest
2020-09-23 18:28:40	+s-d	<N​oob> I like automation. Deployed one of our specialized network stacks I dropped down a 3 day install to 3 hours with the right tools and a bit of prep
2020-09-23 18:28:44	+s-d	<r​mg22893> i'd take a little more stress for a little more excitement (and pay)

2020-09-23 18:29:50	+s-d	<r​mg22893> I could

2020-09-23 18:30:46	+s-d	<N​oob> @PublicWiFi (irc)#0000 that's the plan. I go to a building and  completely rebuild their infrastructure one setup at a time first half of my day everday

2020-09-23 18:31:59	PublicWiFi	My dumpster fire is more like a fire pit now, but this is 1 year in the making lol
2020-09-23 18:32:25	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> so the reason I was looking at SysAdmin was because I thought the ceiling of skill is lower and you become professional sooner.
2020-09-23 18:32:25	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> In Dev you are most of the time still learning and the ceiling is higher I think
2020-09-23 18:32:27	PublicWiFi	Are you a hardware guy? What's your selection process like for new switches and stuff?
2020-09-23 18:32:32	+s-d	<N​oob> I'm fixing 5+ years of building technical debt of a "I plugged in with the shipped version and it works"
2020-09-23 18:32:39	PublicWiFi	Sysadmin are always learning too
2020-09-23 18:32:47	PublicWiFi	tech as a whole never stops changing
2020-09-23 18:32:54	+s-d	<N​oob> Were only authorized to use certain vendors and models per government regs

2020-09-23 18:33:09	+s-d	<N​oob> Yup but we have some choice
2020-09-23 18:33:29	+s-d	<N​oob> All new and replacement devices only have 4 options going forward for standard setup
2020-09-23 18:33:54	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> i just don't know 100% what I wanna become. Most recommend my deveoplemnt since I'm studyin computer science.
2020-09-23 18:33:54	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> That' why I'm here and wondering why you guys not become developers or prefer SysAdmin?
2020-09-23 18:34:16	PublicWiFi	i wish i went dev tbh
2020-09-23 18:34:28	+s-d	<r​mg22893> devs get paid more and don't have to be on call generally so
2020-09-23 18:34:36	+s-d	<r​mg22893> supporting hardware is annoying as hell sometimes
2020-09-23 18:34:37	+s-d	<N​oob> Everything must have layer 3 networking, dual power supplies, a PDU, and a 8x10 gigabit module for uplink ports. Only other options are if you want 24 or 48 port copper or fiber. Same firmware and commands on every system is the goal. Currently support like 8 models up to 12 years old atm
2020-09-23 18:35:05	+s-d	<r​mg22893> but you're always learning either way
2020-09-23 18:35:20	+s-d	<r​mg22893> skill ceiling is only as low as you want it to be
2020-09-23 18:35:23	+s-d	<N​oob> Have an order in to replace about 400-500 switches of various models to the same one. Had to get quotes from three vendors among other things
2020-09-23 18:35:24	+s-d	<r​mg22893> after which point you stagnate
2020-09-23 18:35:29	PublicWiFi	sysadmin can branch into lots of areas
2020-09-23 18:35:35	+s-d	<N​oob> I get an hour a day for learning
2020-09-23 18:35:39	+s-d	<N​oob> And any training I want
2020-09-23 18:35:42	PublicWiFi	a lot of guys here are in some niche areas that started in the sysadmin world

2020-09-23 18:36:00	+s-d	<N​oob> I want to work in a niche area

2020-09-23 20:02:11	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> just curious, lets say your willpower max is 10
2020-09-23 20:02:12	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> learning the basics of development (c#, sql, css, html, javascript) took willpower of 4
2020-09-23 20:02:12	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> how much energy/willpower would it need to learn about cybersecurity?
2020-09-23 20:02:18	fritzwastaken	3
2020-09-23 20:02:21	fritzwastaken	maybe 4 if you are good
2020-09-23 20:02:38	fritzwastaken	jk jk, I have no willpower

2020-09-23 20:04:18	+s-d	<p​arseto> if you want to get really good at cybersecurity - a.k.a learning stuff like binary exploitation and reverse engineering (a.k.a. google project zero level of shit), you need not 10, but 15 willpower
2020-09-23 20:04:53	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> ye i thought so too
2020-09-23 20:05:00	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> like if you wanna become pro
2020-09-23 20:05:15	+s-d	<p​arseto> everyone thinks that knows cybersecurity until .... his/her first breach
2020-09-23 20:06:04	+s-d	<M​itch [Trustworthy]> you mean his first breach - someone ha4king him?
2020-09-23 20:06:09	rpifan	lol

2020-09-27 22:04:20	binaryhermit	sun protection factor maybe?
2020-09-27 22:08:17	Sousapro	SPF is hard because devs want to set up all of the things as fast as possible and can't be arsed with that

2020-09-27 22:15:48	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> mostly
2020-09-27 22:16:53	jelly	better if you isolate vmotion traffic to a separate iface (we use a separate VLAN and 10Gbps interconnect)
2020-09-27 22:17:46	+s-d	<s​unrunner20> its a home environment that doesn't yet have the ability to support that
2020-09-27 22:18:22	jelly	things were _very_ sluggish when we moved old hosts from 4x1Gbps to 2x1Gbps, minutes to vmotion and we only vmotioned RAM, and had shared storage to avoid pumping vmdk over the network

2020-10-02 17:50:58	FatalFUUU	guess it depends on your router nobyk, handy when you're using pfsense
2020-10-02 17:51:13	nobyk	There's a package for pfsense?
2020-10-02 17:51:45	nobyk	(same goes for pfsense, people frown when I say it's a good product)
2020-10-02 17:51:46	FatalFUUU	there are a few, pfblocker? snort, also the squid blocker completely forgot the name
2020-10-02 17:52:25	FatalFUUU	I held off for ages until I spoke to an acquaintance which had basically 50gbe coming into some boxes which had 16gbit ports all running pfsense etc
2020-10-02 17:52:26	+s-d	<H​BK> sure shall look up at it
2020-10-02 17:52:42	FatalFUUU	squidguard*
2020-10-02 17:52:48	+s-d	<H​BK> can i set up pfsense for home
2020-10-02 17:52:51	+s-d	<H​BK> using a PI riht
2020-10-02 17:52:53	+s-d	<H​BK> right ?
2020-10-02 17:53:11	FatalFUUU	problem with squidguard, not working with ssl theses days basically. and I see some adverts running through direct ip
2020-10-02 17:53:12	nobyk	Doesn't have to be a pi
2020-10-02 17:53:24	nobyk	oh you mean pfsense on a pi
2020-10-02 17:53:25	FatalFUUU	pfsense is not meant for the pi
2020-10-02 17:53:47	nobyk	I've never done it but internet says it's a bad idea

2020-10-02 17:58:17	catbeard	though it's not doing DoT or anything
2020-10-02 17:58:38	catbeard	TLS overhead at that scale would be ridiculous

2020-10-03 15:46:33	estranger	house hunting is fun :I
2020-10-03 15:47:05	estranger	it's a seller's market right now in a lot of places, but rates are ridiculous good
2020-10-03 15:47:12	KidBeta	im waiting for it to crash a bit further atm 
2020-10-03 15:47:36	KidBeta	estranger: thats interesting cause over here ive seen a number of places drop 100-200k already
2020-10-03 15:47:59	estranger	yeah it's very regional dependent
2020-10-03 15:48:24	estranger	inventory crashed in some areas
2020-10-03 15:48:27	KidBeta	covid has hit our economy pretty hard though, but thats probably the same for a lot of places.
2020-10-03 15:49:30	estranger	it's a weird cycle, people can't sell their house cus they can't move cus job loss fun covid, so inventory dropsz so the people who can sell are a hot commodity
2020-10-03 15:50:31	KidBeta	estranger: we are having lots of people sell because they cannot afford the mortgage anymore i think.
2020-10-03 15:50:50	estranger	I sold my house full price, with tenants in it, for cash

2020-10-03 15:54:20	estranger	I wasn't making a lot, I never wanted to rent it but when I moved away the market was terrible
2020-10-03 15:54:27	estranger	would have lost money
2020-10-03 15:54:58	KidBeta	a lot of people are relying on huge growth in the value of the house itself to make money
2020-10-03 15:55:04	estranger	I was making like $200/month, not worth the headache
2020-10-03 15:55:20	estranger	yeah, that's often the payout

2020-10-03 20:53:58	sideup66	And after a bit I can relaunch the program but then get some different errors and Spotify is running....but the screen is blank
2020-10-03 20:53:59	shibboleth	don't use chrome/-ium
2020-10-03 20:54:15	sideup66	No, chrome open/closed doesn't affect it
2020-10-03 20:54:30	sideup66	It does leave me with a thought that Spotify is not releasing a resource properly
2020-10-03 20:54:31	shibboleth	don't keep perpetuating what will, in a few years, be looked back on as one of the dumbest things ppl used to do

2020-10-03 21:01:31	sideup66	I'm already kinda embedded in their ecosystem, life isn't bad in the botnet honestly
2020-10-03 21:01:51	sideup66	Besides, a crapple device most likely does it too
2020-10-03 21:01:57	sideup66	They just choose not to tell you ;)
2020-10-03 21:05:36	sideup66	Anyway
2020-10-03 21:12:43	+s-d	<G​ene> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
2020-10-03 21:12:47	+s-d	<G​ene> problem solved sideup66 🙂
2020-10-03 21:13:11	sideup66	? How is updating helping on a brand new install
2020-10-03 21:13:15	sideup66	That is up to date
2020-10-03 21:13:43	+s-d	<H​otmess> are you using universe or multiiverse repo?
2020-10-03 21:13:55	+s-d	<H​otmess> as the default install only uses the default repos for the OS
2020-10-03 21:14:22	+s-d	<H​otmess> if you install chrome on linux usally your using the google repo itself
2020-10-03 21:14:47	+s-d	<H​otmess> https://www.google.com/linuxrepositories/
2020-10-03 21:14:59	+s-d	<H​otmess> at which point you would need to update your repo:L)
2020-10-03 21:15:03	sideup66	.....well it was running chromium from the snap installer in the ubuntu store for chromium
2020-10-03 21:15:09	sideup66	But the underlying code is identical
2020-10-03 21:15:26	+s-d	<H​otmess> ah yeah snap is diffrent:)
2020-10-03 21:15:55	+s-d	<H​otmess> snap is pretty awsome
2020-10-03 21:16:08	+s-d	<H​otmess> as it auto updates
2020-10-03 21:16:28	sideup66	But I've added the apt repos for spotify too to use that version, same problem, my logic is what if I got an older version of spotify desktop, as something added in the latest may be breaking it
2020-10-03 21:16:46	+s-d	<H​otmess> do snap or the repo dont do both
2020-10-03 21:16:52	+s-d	<H​otmess> you can revert to old snap image easily
2020-10-03 21:17:24	+s-d	<H​otmess> snap list intellij-idea-ultimate  --all <
2020-10-03 21:17:32	+s-d	<H​otmess> then sudo snap revert intellij-idea-ultimate --revision 212
2020-10-03 21:17:45	+s-d	<H​otmess> will roll you right back
2020-10-03 21:20:56	sideup66	Ohhhh ok, I'll try it with spotify, it's just a thought

2020-10-04 03:54:30	+s-d	<J​acobC> @Hotmess fucking dev thinks resources are limitless and designed something to require logarithmicially more resources as we increase in scale, so we're doing stuff like turning an 8.25mb XML file into 3gb of TEXT cells in SQL. Our SQL storage array is 250gb.
2020-10-04 03:55:02	+s-d	<J​acobC> well more like he didn't design it to NOT use a shitload of resources
2020-10-04 03:55:02	+s-d	<H​otmess> tell him to sort his shit then
2020-10-04 03:55:06	+s-d	<H​otmess> hes a fucktard
2020-10-04 03:55:09	+s-d	<J​acobC> he's gone
2020-10-04 03:55:14	+s-d	<J​acobC> its my domain now
2020-10-04 03:55:16	+s-d	<H​otmess> horizontal scaling should be a design requirement for him
2020-10-04 03:55:41	+s-d	<H​otmess> sadly i cant code for shit otherwise id offer to help:)
2020-10-04 03:56:01	+s-d	<J​acobC> well I sysadmin like shit generally so 🤷
2020-10-04 03:56:29	+s-d	<J​acobC> actually I'm a competent sysadmin just not a really good one
2020-10-04 03:57:02	+s-d	<p​arseto> lol, 3GB of text is hell of a lot 😄
2020-10-04 03:57:13	+s-d	<H​otmess> i assume your gonna have to completly rebuild it?
2020-10-04 03:57:22	+s-d	<p​arseto> why so much text in one place though? seems wrong
2020-10-04 03:57:27	+s-d	<J​acobC> no, we're writing the data to disk
2020-10-04 03:57:48	+s-d	<J​acobC> if I can find the link in the DB between the file on disk and in SQL I can fix it in 50 lines of code or less
2020-10-04 03:59:15	+s-d	<J​acobC> turn the text column into a series of Codes indicating filename, initial location etc, then program in Nth-tery location searches if looking for it in the first spot fails
2020-10-04 03:59:38	+s-d	<J​acobC> knock it down from 8meg ish per row down to <200 bytes
2020-10-04 04:00:06	+s-d	<p​arseto> ❤️
2020-10-04 04:00:57	+s-d	<J​acobC> allows me to keep the existing structure, so I don't have to spend a couple days and a LARGE outage window making the filesystem and every existing request we're storing match up
2020-10-04 04:01:08	+s-d	<J​acobC> I just revert to old behavior if it doesn't see the codeword
2020-10-04 04:03:03	+s-d	<J​acobC> I just need to think of an attribute seperator that'll absolutely never be used
2020-10-04 04:03:26	+s-d	<J​acobC> something like ";:"
2020-10-04 04:03:59	+s-d	<J​acobC> or maybe a backtick

2020-10-04 04:05:21	+s-d	<p​arseto> you are doing fine 🙂
2020-10-04 04:06:26	+s-d	<J​acobC> yea but I can't do shit with coding the app right now
2020-10-04 04:06:48	+s-d	<J​acobC> its written in a manner that's incompatible with my norm
2020-10-04 04:07:32	+s-d	<J​acobC> it's really mostly just crap code
2020-10-04 04:08:10	+s-d	<J​acobC> I cut the LOC count by 25% by having resharper convert everything to autoproperties
2020-10-04 04:08:37	+s-d	<J​acobC> there's probably another 25% of dead end or otherwise unused code
2020-10-04 04:09:25	+s-d	<J​acobC> I went through 6 layers of one function doing nothing but moving parameters around and calling another function until I got to the one that does stuff earlier this week

2020-10-17 23:40:58	Hunterkll	.......
2020-10-17 23:40:58	GreenBean	I mean this is childhood data we are talking about it
2020-10-17 23:41:05	+s-d	<G​ene> data recovery from a failed drive ~$800-1500. Data recovery from a failed RAID array (think 2x disks failed in a RAID5) ~= $2000+
2020-10-17 23:41:10	Hunterkll	GreenBean: it's all about expansion/contraction of the bearings 
2020-10-17 23:41:12	GreenBean	not some huge enterprise loss
2020-10-17 23:41:18	GreenBean	yes Hunterkll 
2020-10-17 23:41:25	Hunterkll	we're not talking about a benefit per say
2020-10-17 23:41:29	Hunterkll	we're talking about seized lubricant 
2020-10-17 23:41:37	GreenBean	wot
2020-10-17 23:41:44	+s-d	<Z​ero> thats what she said
2020-10-17 23:42:00	Hunterkll	GreenBean: freezer trick is to try and unseize the lubricant through that expansion/contraction which is far greater in the lubricant, not the bearings/voice coils
2020-10-17 23:42:25	GreenBean	yes?
2020-10-17 23:42:36	Hunterkll	right we're not really caring about the metal expansion/contraction
2020-10-17 23:42:46	+s-d	<G​ene> eh, I think in impacts the head.
2020-10-17 23:42:53	GreenBean	well, that's the mechanism by which it all goes
2020-10-17 23:42:56	Hunterkll	heads are irrelevant in this scenario 
2020-10-17 23:43:05	GreenBean	I wasn't talking about heads
2020-10-17 23:43:12	Hunterkll	if heads are an issue, you're physically damaging the platters anyway
2020-10-17 23:43:19	Hunterkll	which freezer won't help
2020-10-17 23:43:25	GreenBean	yes
2020-10-17 23:43:48	GreenBean	<GreenBean> clicking disk might benefit from a nice shrinking
2020-10-17 23:43:50	GreenBean	that's all I said
2020-10-17 23:44:02	Hunterkll	eh i tend to go off on tangents/deep dive
2020-10-17 23:44:03	GreenBean	oh I see how you interpreted it
2020-10-17 23:44:11	Hunterkll	yea
2020-10-17 23:44:15	Hunterkll	it only helps in a specific scenario
2020-10-17 23:44:18	Hunterkll	which you can physically feel
2020-10-17 23:44:23	Hunterkll	in general, the best way is to just NOT
2020-10-17 23:44:39	Hunterkll	freezer trick works for some cases, but not advisable if you actually REALLY care about getting the data back 
2020-10-17 23:44:46	Hunterkll	if it's a seized head, ontrack'll be cheap
2020-10-17 23:45:02	GreenBean	yeah we're talking about childhood data here
2020-10-17 23:45:03	Hunterkll	@Zero for real though, ontrack.com - they don't charge for eval
2020-10-17 23:45:06	GreenBean	not something worth $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
2020-10-17 23:45:09	Hunterkll	they'll give you a quote 
2020-10-17 23:45:15	Hunterkll	GreenBean: for some people that's priceless
2020-10-17 23:45:17	+s-d	<Z​ero> thats cool
2020-10-17 23:45:30	Hunterkll	@Zero eval involves tearing down the drive though, so be prepared to not get it back
2020-10-17 23:45:31	Hunterkll	lol

2020-10-17 23:46:16	Hunterkll	@Zero when you power it up, can you feel it 'bucking' ? 
2020-10-17 23:46:21	+s-d	<G​ene> I mined ~550 btc total or so.

2020-10-17 23:47:04	+s-d	<Z​ero> im not powering it on again, but yeah, i did feel a force
2020-10-17 23:47:06	GreenBean	I smoked out my potcoin
2020-10-17 23:47:07	+s-d	<b​ubu> they had tons of bitcoin, but it's very hard resist not cashing out at when your already at 5-10x gains
2020-10-17 23:47:11	Hunterkll	i used to mine dogecoin on my GTX 770
2020-10-17 23:47:18	GreenBean	dennis rodman actually gave me a few potcoin

2020-10-17 23:48:01	Hunterkll	yea
2020-10-17 23:48:09	Hunterkll	@Zero send it to ontrack for a free eval
2020-10-17 23:48:15	+s-d	<Z​ero> will do

2020-10-18 00:06:40	Hunterkll	@Zero that's okay, there's a web browser preview plugin for VS code which is written on what's essentially a web browser runtime
2020-10-18 00:06:40	+s-d	<Z​ero> so... you're streaming the browser
2020-10-18 00:06:42	Hunterkll	so it's a browser in a browser
2020-10-18 00:07:17	+s-d	<Z​ero> can i stream VS Code?
2020-10-18 00:08:03	+s-d	<Z​ero> its so funny, they've been working on browser integrations, with your file system and even usb controllers
2020-10-18 00:08:07	Hunterkll	It works with most native browsers of choice.
2020-10-18 00:08:12	Hunterkll	so it's not a standalone browser
2020-10-18 00:08:17	Hunterkll	for cloudflare
2020-10-18 00:08:40	+s-d	<Z​ero> gotcha
2020-10-18 00:08:45	+s-d	<Z​ero> so they prerender it
